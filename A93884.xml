            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is ordinary with Writers in their Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catory Epiſtles, highly to extoll and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the Perſons and Vertues of thoſe, to whom they Dedicate their Books; for the moſt part little heeding, whether the Praiſes they give them, be juſt or unjuſt, deſerved or undeſerved: And if any one chance to ask the reaſon, they uſually anſwer, That they Characterize and Paint them out, much like <hi>Xenophon</hi> his <hi>Cyrus;</hi> not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ſuch, as they are, but as they ſhould be: As
<pb facs="tcp:124638:3"/>for my ſelf, I may ſafely and ingenuouſly ſay, that I am very far from theſe mens courſes, or any thing at all, that looketh that way: My main aym hereby, is rather to declare unto others, then to Your Highneſſe, the true Motives and Reaſons, that induced me to Dedicate this Piece unto Your Highneſſe.</p>
            <p>The firſt and chiefeſt was, for that the Subject of this Treatiſe, is concerning the Reformation of Abuſes, and the Extirpation of Schiſms and Hereſies, in the Church of God: Now then, Your Highneſſe's moſt Illuſtrious Predeceſſors have been the firſt of all other Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> or elſe where that received the Reformed Religion in the greateſt Puritie of it; And not onely ſo, but who from time to time have been the ſureſt <hi>Aſylum,</hi> and <hi>Refuge,</hi> to all the Saints of God, that ſuffered for it, yea and a Terrour alſo to all ſuch, as perſecuted it: And this the great Forces, wherewith ſo potently they aſsiſted the <hi>French,</hi> as alſo the <hi>States</hi> of the <hi>Low-Countreys,</hi> ſo oppreſſed by thoſe, who ſo unjuſtly have oppreſſed Your Highneſſe, manifeſteth ſo abund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly, that whoever knoweth it not, muſt be born, and bred with the <hi>Antipodes,</hi> and be altogether a Stranger in the whole Chriſtian World. What alſo thoſe Illuſtrious Princes of bleſſed Memory, Your Father, and Grand-Father, did for the old Duke of <hi>Bouillion,</hi> in all Chriſtian, Civill, and Military Vertues, the very Hero's of His time, I my ſelf and many others, have bin Eye-witneſſes. And as for Your Princely Vertues, I know, that Your
<pb facs="tcp:124638:3"/>Highneſſe taketh no pleaſure to hear them ſo highly commended, as they merit; neither is my Pen able to do it; and if I ſhould attempt any ſuch thing, I am aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, I ſhould come as far ſhort, as he, who would go about to Paint the Sun with a Coal: Nevertheleſſe, this I hold my ſelf bound to ſay unto the World, That I have heard ſundry of the prime men of this <hi>Iſland,</hi> both Noblemen, and Eccleſiaſtiques, yea, thoſe of the moſt Learned and Godly of them, extoll very Highly Your Princely Vertues; and it is no ſmall praiſe and commendation to be praiſed and commended by thoſe, who themſelves are ſo praiſe worthy and commendable. To whom then ſhould I rather Dedicate this Book, that concerneth Reformation, then to his Highneſſe, whoſe Illuſtrious Anceſtors are ſo celebrated in all Hiſtories, for promoting of the bleſſed Work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation? And this, as I ſaid before, God knoweth, I ſay not to flatter Your Highneſſe; but to the end, that Your Highneſſe having ſo great and worthy Examples of ſo Heroick Vertues, and thoſe not far ſought, but found at home, you may thereby be encouraged againſt all difficulties, to go on in that Royall Way, that they have ſcored out unto you: Your Afflictions verily are great, and ſuch as I cannot think upon, but with a bleeding heart, and that no leſſe for our ſelves, then for Your Highneſſe; for alaſſe! what a check, and affront is this put upon all the Proteſtant Churches, to
<pb facs="tcp:124638:4"/>ſee Him brought ſo low, whoſe Predeceſſors put them ſo high, even when they were at their loweſt ebbe? What a diſhonour muſt it needs be to the three Kingdoms, to ſee the Kings Majeſties Nephew reduced to ſuch an Eſtate? What ſerveth our Alliance for? What eſteem can For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Nations make of us, who eſteem no more our own Blood? Truely, God hath put your greateſt Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies very low; Some alſo, who formerly have hindered that ſeaſonable Aſsiſtance, that we ſhould have afforded you, are now themſelves on the ſuffering hand; And who knoweth, whether this be not one of the preſent quarrels God hath againſt us at this time? Oh! that God would pitty us ſo far, as that we could but once learn to pitty our ſelves; then might His Majeſtie be a glorious King; we moſt happy Subjects; and You, Right Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious Prince, ſoon be reſtored to Your Ancient Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignties, and Dominions, ſo long, and ſo unjuſtly u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurped upon You, by Yours, ours, and all Proteſtant Princes open and profeſſed Enemy: And now it ſeemeth, that God hath already prepared the way, if we could prepare our ſelves to enter into it: We ſee how the Lord hath powred out his vengeance upon the <hi>Houſe of Auſtria,</hi> and raiſed up againſt it the <hi>French,</hi> whoſe Predeceſſors ſtand ſo many wayes obliged to Your Highneſſe's Houſe, and that of late memory, yea, in our own times: We have ſeen heretofore what hath been the King of <hi>Denmarks</hi> zeal in this Cauſe; and I doubt not,
<pb facs="tcp:124638:4"/>but the States of the <hi>Low-Countreys</hi> would contribute as much, as any other, to put down their Immortall Enemy, and to raiſe up again their old Confederate, and deareſt Friend. If at this preſent, when other Princes are in Arms one againſt another, we could ſerve our ſelves of ſuch an occaſion, to make a Peace here at home, we might eaſily procure an happy Agreement amongſt our Friends and Confederates abroad; ſo we might make our ſelves no leſſe conſiderable every where, by ſuch a Peace, then now by our Diſtractions, we are inconſiderable to all the World. But this I leave, and return to Your Highneſſe: In a word; my aym in pleading here, for a Reformation, is to let all true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants know, how this Diſpute is due to Your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; and how they ſtand all bound in Conſcience, to take to heart the Cauſe of ſuch a Prince, whoſe Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors were the firſt Reformed, and trueſt Reformers, and who Himſelf, in the midſt of ſo many <hi>Temptations,</hi> ſo conſtantly continueth in their wayes: If they ſhould (which God forbid) forget ſo great Services, that thoſe never ſufficiently commended Princes of Your Illuſtrious Houſe have done for the <hi>Cauſe of God,</hi> they could not but prove very unthankfull, both to God, and to Your Highneſſe: And yet in ſuch a caſe, muſt not Your Highneſſe for all that looſe courage; Your Cauſe is his Cauſe, who is All-Sufficient; And therefore Your Highneſſe will do well to caſt Your
<pb facs="tcp:124638:5"/>Self wholly upon him, attending his good pleaſure; and I am aſſured, that Your deliverance ſhall come in his good time; which, that he would be pleaſed to haſten, So prayeth, ſo hopeth, ſo earneſtly deſireth he, who is wholly reſolved, in all ſincerity, all his life long, to remain</p>

                  <p>Afterwards in the ſame page, he accuſeth me of contradicting my ſelfe, in following Propoſitions.</p>
                  <p>The Parliament has no directive Power by teaching, Preaching, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The Parliament is wiſe enough to know what is convenient for the Church.</p>

A little after, viz. p. 34. §. 2. this judicious Obſervator of Contradictions declareth ingeniouſly, that he knoweth not what I meane by a <hi>Directive Power;</hi> and yet here he telleth me, that I <hi>contradicted</hi> my ſelfe: but how is it poſſible, that he ſhould know that I contradicted my ſelfe in that, that he himſelfe underſtands not: He knoweth not what things I poſe, and yet he findeth them oppoſed one to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. I finde him here oppoſed to himſelfe, and in finding out a <hi>contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> in my words, he <hi>contradicteth</hi> himſelfe, and ſo taketh away this pretended <hi>contradiction.</hi>
                  </p>

That the Civill Magiſtrate, <hi>qua talis,</hi> is he who governeth the State, <hi>qua talem;</hi> I ſay <hi>qua talis,</hi> and <hi>qua talem;</hi> for it may fall out, that he who is a Civill Magiſtrate to governe the State, may alſo be choſen to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne the Church in quality of a Ruling Elder, &amp;c. but that he doth not, in quality of a Civill Magiſtrate, for then he ſhould not need to be choſen to be a Ruling Elder; for in quality of a Civill Magiſtrate already he ſhould have had that power.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Learne, that by the word <hi>Church</hi> I underſtand the <hi>Viſible, Militant Church,</hi> both <hi>reall,</hi> and <hi>repreſentative</hi> in Church Officers, viz. 1.

In Nationall, and 5. in Oecumenicall Synods; but ſo, that it muſt be taken ſometimes for the reall Church alone, as when we ſay, <hi>The Presbytery ruleth the Church:</hi> ſometimes for the repreſentative alone, as when we ſay, <hi>Tell the Church:</hi> and evermore, <hi>ratione ſubjectae materiae.</hi>
                  </p>

For the Power of Ruling, whether it be Directive, Imperative, or Executive, belongeth not to us by birth, as naturall powers; nor can we pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe it by our owne induſtry alone, as we doe Naturall Habitudes: nor is it evermore ſupernaturall or infuſed by God, as we ſee in the Civill Power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Pagans; yea it is very probable, that ſome Preachers may have an Eccleſiaſticall Power, who have no Supernaturall, but only their aturall gifts. 2.

Now the <hi>aſſent of the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:124638:7"/>underſtanding and deſtination of the vvill,</hi> (ſince they are immanent actions, and no wayes tranſient) cannot produce any reall or permanent effect out of themſelves: And yet however it be no <hi>reall faculty, habitude or ability, yet both can it poſe, and</hi> indeed it doth preſuppoſe <hi>ſome reall being:</hi> for in puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Malefactours it poſeth ſometimes a very <hi>reall eff ct,</hi> as that of burning and hanging of perſons; and before it be, it <hi>preſuppoſeth the naturall faculties of the ſoule,</hi> ſome <hi>naturall habitudes or abilities therein, as that of juriſprudence, in Civill Magiſtrates and Iudges:</hi> ſometimes ſome <hi>ſupernaturall habitudes alſo,</hi> as that of divine faith. <hi>Eccleſiaſticall charges, as in Apoſtles, Prophets, Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, and Paſtors.</hi> 2. Becauſe a man in receiving of ſuch a <hi>Povver, poteſtas or charge,</hi> findes no <hi>reall changement</hi> in himſelfe, as in receiving of a new <hi>reall being, or quality.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>No more can it formally conſiſt in the reall being, qualities, or effects, that the charge or this power produceth; for they are all poſterior to it.</p>
                  <p>So it may be defined a worke of reaſon, or a morall being, whereby he who is ſufficiently called, by ſufficient aſſent and deſtination of the Will of thoſe who call him, and conſent of his own, and endowed with ſufficient abilities, may juſtly exerciſe ſuch acts as they intend by ſuch a calling. I call it, 1. a work of Reaſon, &amp;c. to the excluſion of the works of Nature. 2. I ſay, He who is called. Here you have, 1. the Subject of this power, viz. <hi>He.</hi> 2. The efficient cauſe thereof, ſomewhat obſcurely expreſſed, by ſufficient Calling; and afterward, 3. more diſtinctly, by the <hi>aſſent and deſtination of the will of thoſe who call him, and conſent of the perſon called.</hi> 4. <hi>Endowed, &amp;c.</hi> Here is expreſſed the <hi>fundamentum remotum</hi> of this charge, whereby he is enabled to the acts of this power. 5. <hi>May juſtly exerciſe, &amp;c.</hi> Here is the <hi>finis,</hi> or act of this power, wherein we have to obſerve, that this act may be conſidered, 1. in its natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie; 2. In its habitualitie or facultie; 3. In its moralitie; 4. In its particular legalitie. The firſt is from the naturall faculties of the Soule; The ſecond, from the habitudes or abilities thereof; The third is from morall habitudes in the Will: The fourth from this <hi>poteſtas;</hi> the naturall facultie maketh it an act; the habitudes or abilities, an habituall act, or eaſily produced by the ſoul, if it be meerly naturall: (but if it be a ſupernaturall act, <hi>quoad ſubſtantiam,</hi> then there muſt be ſome ſupernatural habitude, that ſupplieth the place both of the deficient facultie, and habitude or abilitie) the vertue of juſtice in the will, i. a juſt act: but this morall power, or <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, maketh it a legall and publique act, for what before his calling he could not doe, but illegally, (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he had abilities enough) now after his calling, he can doe legally. <hi>Item,</hi> this morall power induceth a morall obligation to obedience, which all his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall powers, all his naturall and ſupernaturall habitudes, and all his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular morall vertues and juſtice, could not doe without it.</p>
                  <p>This morall power is either private or particular, as the Paternall, Maritall,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:124638:7"/>(if it be meerly morall) and deſpoticall, in domeſticall and ſuch like ſocieties, whereof we ſpeak not; Or publique, as that of the Secular Magiſtrate, and Eccleſiaſticall Iudge: and evermore it produceth an obligation unto obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in thoſe that are ſubject thereunto: So the power of the Civill Magiſtrate binds the Subject to Civill, and that of Eccleſiaſticall perſons, the people to Eccleſiaſticall or ſpirituall obedience; That of the Husband, the Wife, to conjugall; that of the Father, the Sonne, to filiall; and that of the Lord, the ſervant, to ſervile obedience or ſervice.</p>
                  <p>This power, as it is in Church-Officers, is either <hi>Directive</hi> or <hi>Executive,</hi> and this either <hi>imperative,</hi> or <hi>ſtrictly executive:</hi> Or if you like better of a Trichotomie, it is either Directive, Imperative, or Executive. The directive power of the Church, is that whereby ſhe ſheweth us what is to be believed or done; which is done by Teaching, Eccleſiaſticall judgements, Lawes, and the interpretation thereof, whereby we are directed and taught. The Imperative power is, whereby ſhe commands what is to be done: as, <hi>Hoc fac:</hi> which the Doctors of the Laws ordinarily expreſſe, by <hi>jubeo, impero, mando;</hi> and ſome Kings, by this; <hi>For it is our will and pleaſure.</hi> The Executive power is, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Eccleſiaſticall judgements are put in execution; which is done by binding and looſing, in ſome wayes anſwerable to diſtributive Iuſtice, remunerative and coercive.</p>
                  <p>Now to befriend yet more this Mans underſtanding, and to ſhew the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Reader how fairly I deale with him, and all thoſe of his party, not hiding my ſelfe, as they ordinarily doe, I give another note very neceſſary in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which I hope ſhall diſcover a great part of theſe mens cavils and frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulent ſophiſtications: and it is this: <hi>viz.</hi> That the power <hi>circa Spiritualia &amp; Eccleſiaſtica,</hi> about Spirituall and Eccleſiaſticall matters, is either <hi>intrinſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call to the Church,</hi> i. e. not only about the Church, but alſo in the Church; as that of Church officers, which is only in the Church or Church officers, in quality of Church and Church officers; as the power to preach, to excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, &amp;c. for no other but Eccleſiaſticall perſons can preach, or excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate; Neither can the Civill Magiſtrate, or any other, exerciſe ſuch acts. Or <hi>Extrinſecall,</hi> i. e. about the Church, but not in the Church, in quality of a Church; as when the Civill Magiſtrate maketh Lawes concerning the Church, in confirming or ratifying her lawes, in making them to be received as well in the State as in the Church; So <hi>Juſtinian</hi> declared, that according to the Evangelicall doctrine and Apoſtolicall diſcipline, all men ſhould be called Chriſtians; otherwayes that they ſhould be declared diſtracted and infamous perſons: and that they that were puniſhed ſpiritually by the Church, ſhould afterwards be puniſhed civilly, by the civil Magiſtrate: as we may ſee in the firſt book of the <hi>Codex, tit. de ſumma Trinitate, tit. de ſacroſanctis Eccleſiis, tit. de
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:124638:8"/>Epiſc. &amp; Cler. &amp; Orphanotroph.</hi> And through all the firſt thirteen Titles of that book, and elſwhere in the Civill Lawes. But this power to judge, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and puniſh, is not Eccleſiaſticall, but Civill.</p>

                  <p>THis being preſuppoſed, I put my firſt Concluſion thus: The Civill Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, <hi>qua talis,</hi> or under the notion of a Civill Magiſtrate, hath no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecall power in the Church:
<list>
                        <item>1. Becauſe the Scripture, which Independents acknowledge for the only rule of Church-Government, conteineth no ſuch thing.</item>
                        <item>2. Becauſe his authoritie, <hi>qua talis,</hi> is not Eccleſiaſticall, but Politicall or Civill, <hi>Ergo, qua talis,</hi> it is not intrinſecall to the Church.</item>
                        <item>3. Becauſe ſuch muſt be his power or authoritie in the Church, as the acts thereof, at leaſt <hi>in genere morum,</hi> or morally. But the acts of his power, as to puniſh refractorie perſons in a Civill way, by impriſonment, pecuniary mulcts, &amp;c. are not intrinſecall, yea no wayes Eccleſiaſticall, <hi>Ergo,</hi> no more is his power or authority.</item>
                        <item>4. Becauſe the authority that is intrinſecall unto the Church, muſt be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed by Eccleſiaſticall perſons. But ſo is not that of the Civill Magiſtrate. The Minor is certaine, becauſe it is only to be exerciſed by the Civill Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, or his officers; and not by Elders of the Church: as when he impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons any man for his diſobedience unto the Church, or puts Apoſtates, or ſome abominable Hereticks to death, as <hi>Servet.</hi> &amp;c. And it is a certaine maxime, that, <hi>Eccleſia neſcit ſanguinem:</hi> as may appeare by ſundry Canons of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non Law. <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Major is indubitable, becauſe the power, and the exerciſe thereof belongeth unto the ſame ſort of perſons.</item>
                        <item>5. Becauſe the Civill Magiſtrate himſelfe, <hi>qua talis,</hi> is no Eccleſiaſticall perſon, or Intrinſecall unto the Church, ſince he may be a Pagan; how then can his authority be Eccleſiaſticall, or Intrinſecall unto the Church, ſince the authority of a perſon out of the Church, <hi>qua talis,</hi> muſt be Extrinſecall, or out of the Church?</item>
                        <item>6. Becauſe the object of the intrinſecall power of the Church is principally <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, things that are ſpirituall, or for ſpirituall ends; But ſo is not that of the Civill Magiſtrate; ſince oftentimes he knoweth him not, as when he is a Turk or a Pagan.</item>
                        <item>7. Becauſe this opinion confounds the Kingdome of this World, with that of Chriſt, in granting unto the Civill Magiſtrate the Intrinſecall power of the Church, which Chriſt only granted unto the Miniſters therof, viz. unto Preachers, Teachers, and ruling Elders. But ſo ſhould it not be; for Chriſt
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:124638:8"/>diſtinguiſhed theſe powers, when he commanded to <hi>give unto God that which is Gods, and unto Caeſar that which is Caeſars,</hi> Mat. 22.21.</item>
                        <item>8. Becauſe the immediate rule of the intrinſecall power of the Church, is only Gods Word, formally, by conſequence or preſuppoſition: ſo is it not in reſpect of the Civill Magiſtrates power, which is immediately and formally ruled by the Lawes of the State; <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Civill Magiſtrates power is not intrinſecall unto the Church.</item>
                        <item>9. The intrinſecall power of the Church is only Miniſteriall, no wayes De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoticall, Imperiall, Regall, Majeſticall, or Majeſtie: So is not that of the Civill Magiſtrate, in taking the word in a large ſignification, as it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, for the ſupreme and ſubalterne Magiſtrate; For the power of the Civil Magiſtrate, at leaſt in the Supreme or Prince, is not Miniſteriall, but ſometimes Deſpoticall or Lordly, ſometimes Imperiall, ſometimes Regall, ſometimes A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtocraticall, ſometimes Democraticall, and evermore Majeſticall. <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Aſſumption is certaine; ſo is the Propoſition: for they who have this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecall power in the Church, are only Chriſts Miniſters and Servants.</item>
                        <item>10. Becauſe (as we ſaid heretofore) not only the Civill Magiſtrate ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times is not a member of the true Church of Chriſt, but is a member of the Antichriſtian Church, yea ſometimes not ſo much as Chriſtned, or a Chriſtian by name; as the Tuck the Emperor, the French King, and ſome others, who by maxime of State, have made ſome Edicts in favour of true Chriſtians, for the exerciſe of their Religion. But how ſhall he that is not in the Church, that is no true Chriſtian, yea that is an Antichriſtian Chriſtian, yea not ſo much as a Chriſtian by name, but an open Enemy to the name of Chriſt, as <hi>Herod, Nero, Diocleſian, Julian</hi> the Apoſtate, that are externall unto the Church, have any intrinſecall power in the Church?</item>
                        <item>11. Becauſe the Civill Magiſtrate hath no intrinſecall power, either di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rective or executive, in common Trades, as that of Brewers, Shoemakers, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Watermen, &amp;c. whoſe trades are within the reach of Nature, and which he directeth only extrinſecally: Neither knoweth the King how to brew, how to make ſhooes, &amp;c. neither can he brew, or make ſhooes: How much leſſe then is it needfull that he have any interne power, either directive or executive, in Eccleſiaſticall matters, which are altogether ſpirituall and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall, above the reach of all naturall prudence, and quite out of the ſphere of his activitie.</item>
                        <item>12. By the ſame reaſon the Civill Magiſtrate ſhould have an internall power both directive and executive, over all Oeconomicall Societies under him, viz. over the Husband and the Wife, the Father and the Son, the Maſter and the Servant. He might direct them in their duties, and execute their char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges intrinſecally, and ſo doe the duty of a Husband, of a Father and Maſter in all things, in every mans familie, which could not but be found very abſurd,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:124638:9"/>impious, and altogether intolerable. Heretofore the Independents did, as much as any men, complaine of ſuch an abſolute and independent power in the King: How then is it, that now they grant it?</item>
                        <item>13. If ſuch an intrinſecall power in Eccleſiaſticall matters, be a part of all civill Magiſtrates power; then the Magiſtrates who have it not, are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat and perfect Magiſtrates, ſince they want one of the principall parts of the civill Magiſtrates power, <hi>viz.</hi> The intrinſecall, directive, and executive power in Eccleſiaſticall matters. But the conſequent is untrue, yea criminall, and trayterous; for many Pagans, Antichriſtians, yea in <hi>concreto,</hi> and in <hi>ſenſu com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſito</hi> have a full and perfect civill power over their Subjects, and yet are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of all ſuch intrinſecall or Eccleſiaſticall power, either directive, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutive; ſince neither they know nor will know the word of God, which is the only directive or regulative principle in Eccleſiaſtical matters &amp; Government: neither ever do they or will they exerciſe any of theſe powers; yea they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce them both. Now morally he is not ſaid to have power to exerciſe an Act, who never exerciſes, nor will exerciſe it, but renounces it, and all power unto it. <hi>Ergo,</hi>

If the civill Magiſtrate, in qualitie of civill Magiſtrate, hath any ſuch intrinſecall power or authority about the Church, Church buſineſſe, and Religion, then muſt it not be called only a politicall, civill, or ſecular, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo an Eccleſiaſticall and ſpirituall power; Yea, the civill Magiſtrate, and his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, muſt as well be defined by ſpirituall and Eccleſiaſticall actions of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and Government, and by ſpirituall and Eccleſiaſtiall matters, as by civill actions and matters; for it is ordinary to define all faculties, habitudes, and all naturall or morall powers and authorities by their acts and objects whereunto they have any intrinſecall reference, as <hi>viſum per viſibile; audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum per audibile, Logicam per</hi>

                  <p n="37">37.

All this ſaith the Text, and no leſſe; 2 <hi>King.</hi> 15.5. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26.16, 17, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="38">38. The Civill Magiſtrate may be received unto the Magiſtracy, before he be a member of the Church: for the Independents receive no man, yea, not the Kings Majeſty, and the Parliament, to be members of their Church, but after a long tryall: Yea, however they profeſſe the Orthodox Religion, and live Chriſtianly, not giving offence to any man, <hi>Ergo,</hi> in ſuch a caſe the civill Magiſtrate is out of the Church, and ſo muſt his authority be, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, neither he, <hi>qua talis,</hi> nor his authority is intrinſecall unto the Church, ſo long as he is out of the Church; for the Magiſtrates authority can be no more intrinſecall unto the Church, then the Magiſtrate himſelfe is.</p>
                  <p>And if it be ſaid, that the Civill Magiſtrates authority is intrinſecall unto the Church, but not the Civill Magiſtrate: I anſwer, That then the Church
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:124638:11"/>hath the civill Magiſtrates authority, and not his perſon; ſo the Church hath the Magiſtracy, and not the Magiſtrate, and ſo the Church has civill, <hi>viz.</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall, Royall, or Deſpoticall authority over the ſubjects: But that cannot be ſaid, for it is Treaſon; Chriſts Kingdom is not of this world, and the Church beareth no materiall ſword.</p>
                  <p n="39">39. The Intrinſecall way to governe Chriſts Church is convenient unto Gods wiſdome, ſince it is an act of wiſdome, and divine providence: But an Intrinſecall power granted to Heathen, and Antichriſtian Chriſtians, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, to govern Chriſts Church, is not convenient unto his wiſdome, but repugnant unto it; for it is, as if he ſhould chooſe a Wolfe to keepe the Lambs, and a Kite to ſhelter the Chickens, which are not meanes convenient unto ſuch ends.</p>
                  <p n="40">40. Such a ſort of Government is repugnant unto Gods mercy towards his Church, for how is it credible that he, who has given Chriſt his onely Sonne for his Church, to redeeme her, ſhould give her Antichriſts and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans to leade her away from Chriſt to Antichriſt, yea to the Devill, and Hell it ſelfe, from which he hath redeemed her.</p>
                  <p n="41">41. I might here aske what Magiſtrate has this Intrinſecall power; whether the Supreame, or the Subalterne? If the Supreame, then he has ſuch an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the Church, as in the State, <hi>viz.</hi> Monarchicall, Deſpoticall, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall, Royall, &amp;c. Ariſtocraticall, or Democraticall; ſo the Government of the Church is not one, but manifold, and may change, and be diverſified, as the governments of this world: If the Subalterne has it alſo, then it muſt be derived unto him from the Prince or Soveraigne; <hi>Nulla enim poteſtas, niſi in Principe, aut a Principe;</hi> there is no power, but in the Prince, or from the Prince, ſo Eccleſiaſticall charges ſhall be venall or ſaleable, as Subalterne Magiſtracies in ſome Kingdomes are, where the only way to be preferred unto them, is, that notable Maxime of old <hi>Judas, Quantum mihi dabitis?</hi>

                     <hi>Concluſ.</hi> II. THe Civill Magiſtrate hath an extrinſecall, both Directive and Executive power about the Church, whereby not onely he may rule it by Politicall Lawes, as Pagan, but alſo as Chriſtian; becauſe he is, or ſhould be a Nurſing Father of the Church, <hi>Eſay.</hi> 49.23. who 1. is bound to admit in his Kingdome the true Church, and true Religion. 2. He has power, not to admit it, to reject it, yea when it is not received or approved, and confirmed by his ſecular and civill authority, to reject it, and exile it, however he do it not as a Nurſe of the Church. 3. If the Church be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:124638:12"/>and Church Officers negligent in their charge, and will not reforme it, he may command, yea compell them to do it. Or if they will not, he may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily do it himſelfe. 5. When the Church is Reformed, he may command them, when they are negligent, to be diligent in their charge. 6. If they oppreſſe any man in their Eccleſiaſticall judgements and cenſures, againſt the Lawes of the Kingdome, he may deſire them, yea, command them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe their judgements; and in caſe they reforme them not, command them, yea compell them by his civill power, to give him ſatisfaction, according to the Lawes of the Kingdome, if they derogate not from the Law of God. 7. He may, yea he is bound to provide ſufficient maintenance for the Miniſters of the Churches, and to take a care that their meanes be not delapidated, and that they be not Sacrilegiouſly robbed of them. 8. And what here I ſay of the Church, I ſay alſo of Univerſities and Schooles, that are the Seminaries of able men for the Church. 9. He may grant unto the Church ſome Liberties, Priviledges, or Immunities, as ſundry Princes have done, and confirme them by Law, as we ſee in the Civill Law. 10. He is bound with his Civill power to maintaine the Order, and Diſcipline of the Church; and conſequently: 11. To hinder all diſorder in it. And 12. By his Civill Authority, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell all refractory perſons to obey the Church. And 13. To baniſh, and exile all Sects, Schiſmes, and Hereſies, as we may ſee by ſundry of the Roman Lawes, and eſpecially in the firſt 13. Titles of the firſt booke of <hi>Inſtinians</hi> Codex, in the Pandects and elſe where. All this we grant to the Civill Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate; and if the <hi>Quinq Eccleſian</hi> Miniſters with the reſt of that Sect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt it not, we need not to prove it; only we ſay, that he doth all this by a Civill and Secular, Supreame, Imperiall, Royall, Ariſtocraticall, or Democra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall, Legiſlative, and coactive Power, armed with the ſword, howſoever extrinſecall to the Church; but more Abſolute, Independent, and Potent <hi>in ſuo genere,</hi> then any Eccleſiaſticall Power whatſoever, which is Intrinſecall to the Church, which is no waies Abſolute, nor Independent, but Dependent; no waies Coactive by Externall force, but Spirituall, meerly Miniſteriall (howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever imperative in the name of God) that cannot make any Lawes, but of things meerely Circumſtantiall, much leſſe abrogate the Lawes concerning the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and Government of the Church, already made by God in his Word.</p>
                  <p>Now that the Magiſtrate hath an extrinſecall Power over the Church, in compelling all refractory perſons to ſubmit themſelves to her juſt commands, ſince <hi>M.

We have yet ſome other examples, 16. of <hi>Phineas,</hi> 17. <hi>Heliah,</hi> 18. <hi>Mattathias,</hi> 19. <hi>Judah,</hi> and ſome others, who in quality of extraordinary Iudges, puniſhed Hereticks and Idolaters, yea ſome of them by death, <hi>Num.</hi> 25.8. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18.40. 1 <hi>Macch.</hi> 2. 2 <hi>Macch.</hi> 36. Now howbeit theſe acts of extraordinary Iudges are not to be drawn into conſequence by private perſons: nevertheleſſe they are to be imitated by ordinary Iudges: for, what they did extraordinarily in reſpect of their calling, and in quality of Iudges, ordinary Iudges ſhould doe it ordinarily, ſince it is their ordinary charge, as the others extraordinarily, and is commended in Scripture.</p>
                  <p>We have ſome examples in the New Teſtament: in S. <hi>Peters</hi> perſon, who in quality of an extraordinary Iudge, when there was no Chriſtian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, put to death <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphyra,</hi> for their hypocriſie and diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.5.10.

Now what they did as extraordinary Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, not being ordinary, the ordinary Magiſtrate may doe it ordinarily, as an ordinary act of his charge.</p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:124638:13"/>
                  <p>We have alſo the expreſſe commandement of God, to puniſh the Idolater, Heretick, or <hi>falſe Prophet, and dreamer of dreames,</hi> be he never ſo neare to us, <hi>wife, brother, ſonne, friend, &amp;c.</hi> Deut. 13.1. And the reaſon is, becauſe <hi>He hath ſpoken to turne you away from the Lord your God,</hi> v. 5.10. So, whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſeduceth us from the Lord our God, as Hereticks, are to ſuffer, if they be pertinacious; Yea, whole Cities are to be deſtroyed for this ſin, ver. 15. See <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.20. <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.2.</p>
                  <p>Yea, it was not ſo much as permitted to the people of God to make any Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, or mariage with Idolatrous people, for feare of turning them away from Gods ſervice, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.11.15. <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.10. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9.

                  <p>We nave the Romane lawes, in the firſt Book of the Code of <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> through all the firſt 14 or 15 Titles, and elſwhere, to this very Head.</p>
                  <p>So we have ſolemn Covenants in Scripture, to obſerve the Law of God, and conſequently the firſt Commandement, and ſo to deſtroy Hereſie and Schiſmes, which are contrary to it: As (1) that of <hi>Moſes,</hi> pronouncing ſundry benedicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the keepers, and curſes to the tranſgreſſors thereof, <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. &amp; 28.

Our own <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> alſo obligeth the Magiſtrate to puniſh all Hereticks and Schiſmaticks, and the People to aſſiſt him herein: yea, the Independents themſelves, in as much as they have entred into the ſame <hi>Covenant,</hi> ſtand equally obliged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Religion, according to their power. Now God hath given them the power to reforme it, in puniſhing Hereticks and Schiſmaticks, according to their demerits; which if either We, or They doe not, we are forſworne, and God one day will call us to an account.</p>

                  <p>NOw what ſayes <hi>M. S.</hi> to all this, who was ſo deſirous of ſome proofes from Scripture?</p>
                  <p>His firſt Anſwer is, That <hi>A. S.</hi> bringeth thoſe Examples, for want of better Arguments.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A. S. Rep.</hi> 1. And ſo he jeereth Gods Word. 2. Wherefore are not Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments drawne from Gods Word, good enough in matter of Religion?
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:124638:14"/>3. Theſe Examples are approved in Scripture, and therefore may very well have the force of a Command.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>M. S.</hi> 2. His ſecond Anſwer is, that none of the good Kings of <hi>Iudah</hi> ever offered any violence to the true Prophets of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A. S.</hi> Repl. Neither ſay I any ſuch thing, only I ſay they had a Royall, or Politicall Power (which was extrinſecall unto the Church, or of another nature, as your Apologiſts ſpeake) to conſerve the true Religion; and in caſe of corruption to reforme it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>M. S.</hi> his third Anſwer proves nothing for the perſecuting, annoying, cruſhing, diſgracing, baniſhing, fining the Apologiſts, whom himſelfe (more then once, or twice) acknowledgeth for very Pious, Godly, and Learned men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A. S.</hi> Neither bring I them to prove any ſuch thing, I hope they ſhall prove no falſe Prophets, Hereticks, Schiſmaticks, to be ſo dealt with. 2. Only I bring theſe Paſſages to prove, that the Civill Magiſtrate may, and is bound in duty to puniſh all falſe Prophets, Hereticks and Schiſmaticks, whoever they be. And howbeit they could perchance finde favour enough to eſtabliſh themſelves in one time, by a Princes Authority, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all that another, or the very ſame Prince upon better information, yea, or a ſubſequent Parliament may, nay ought to revoke any ſuch favour ſo granted them, and to puniſh the Sectaries, as thoſe good Kings did. Whereas he ſaith, that I acknowledge the Apologiſts for Pious Perſons; I Anſwer; Heretofore I judged ſo of them, by a judgement of Charity, which beleeveth all things; but I would pray him, and them both, under pretext of ſuch a charitable Iudgement of mine, not to be too licentious in broaching, or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing of erronious Opinions, leaſt they make me to write ſome Booke of Retractations, which he, and they will certainly force me to doe, if they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue: Neither ſhall I be aſhamed if they deceive me, but I hope better things of them: And God forbid that they ſhould goe on upon his violent courſe, rather to ſufferdeath, then to change: God change his heart, and I hope in his Mercy he ſhall doe it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>M. S.</hi> 4. He ſaith: Neither did any of thoſe Kings ever compell any man to the Iewiſh Religion, nor yet to profeſſe the Iewiſh Religion againſt their judgements.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A. S.</hi> They could not compell their heart or will, but at leaſtwiſe they hindred them from the Externall Acts of idolatry, and other Religions, ſo far forth as death could hinder them, as appeared from all thoſe Texts. They could alſo compell their externall actions, read the members of their body to give no offence unto the Church of God; If they could not cut off an ill will, yet could they cut away an ill tongue.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>M. S.</hi> 5. <hi>Anſwereth.</hi> It was permitted to Perſons of other Nations to live amongſt them without being Circumciſed, yea or without ſmarting for want.</p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:124638:14"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A. S.</hi> But he bringeth no Text of Scripture to prove, that when the <hi>Iewes</hi> were a free people, and had good Rulers, they then permitted any ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſed men to live amongſt them. 2. Neither doth this any thing againſt my Argument, which only proveth a Politicall Power in the Civill Magiſtrate, who is Extrinſecall to the Church, whereby he might puniſh Idolaters, falſe Prophets, and Prieſts, for their Idolatries, falſe Doctrine, and Worſhip. 3. If he did it not, he ſinned againſt the Covenant. 4. However ſuch might live amongſt them for ſome time uncircumciſed; yet could they not be Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, or true Denizens without Circumciſion. 5. Much leſſe was the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of uncircumciſed Perſons tolerated amongſt them in the times of good Judges, or Kings, as appearech by all thoſe Texts. 6. But leaſt of all had they power to write Bookes againſt their Religion, as the Independents doe here in face of the Parliament, and the Aſſembly againſt ours. 7. Yea they could not ſo much as take a ſtranger to their Wife, as we read, <hi>Ezra</hi> chap. 9. and 10. and in the Covenant, <hi>Neh.</hi> 10. ver. 30. and 13.23, 24, 25. where it is ſaid, that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> ſmote them for ſuch Marriages, and pluckt off their haire, v. 27, 28. And <hi>Ezra,</hi> chap. 10. made them to put away their ſtrange Wives, and ſuch as were borne of them. Wherefore then may not the Chriſtian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate doe as much?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>M. S.</hi> 6. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Nor doe we ever read that ever they attempted any thing againſt any Sectaries, or Schiſmaticks (as <hi>A. S.</hi> would call them) which yet abounded in great variety, and numbers amongſt them, as Scribes, or Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, or Herodians, or Perſons of any other Sect in the Profeſſion of the Iewiſh Religion, that lived peaceably in their State. Idolatry and Idolaters were, as it ſeemes, the adequate Object of their coercive power in matters of Religion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A. S.</hi> Repl. But we read, that they attempted ſomething againſt falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, if death be any attempt againſt them, as all the Texts, cited by me, ſhew evidently. 2. I deny your Conſequence; we read it not, <hi>Ergo</hi> it was not, for we cannot argue <hi>à teſtimonio negativè,</hi> yea, not of Scripture, unleſſe it be in things neceſſary to ſalvation, ſuch as are not Hiſtories of particular facts. 3. The cauſe wherefore we read it not is, becauſe under good Iudges or Kings, they were never tolerated: ill Kings would not puniſh them; but their examples are not to be drawne in Conſequence. 4. As for the Scribes, Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, and Herodians, no wonder, if they were not puniſhed. 1. For theſe Sects begun very late, not long before the comming of Chriſt, when the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion was mightily corrupted, which Chriſt came to reforme. 2. Becauſe the <hi>Iewes</hi> were not then a free people, neither had they the Civill Power ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely in their owne hands. 3. They had no good Rulers. 4. No more were the <hi>Sadduces</hi> puniſhed, who denyed Gods Providence, the Reſurrection of the Body, the Immortality of the Soule, and all ſpirituall natures, as ſome teſtifie of them; and yet they were more puniſhed by Gods Law, then Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:124638:15"/>ſince their errour was greater; ſo ſhould the <hi>Herodians</hi> have been pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, ſince they tooke <hi>Herod</hi> to be the Meſſias, and that he ſhould come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine after that he had been ſtrucken by the Angell; and yet they were not puniſhed. 5. The Idolaters were to be puniſhed, and yet they lived in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Iewiſh Religion, for they apoſtatized not. It is falſe, that the Idolatry was the adequate Object of their coercive power, for they alſo were puniſhed, who married ſtrange Women, &amp;c. It is alſo a miſtake in him, to think, Scribe was the name of a Sect, it is not the name of a Sect, but of an Office, or Profeſſion; for one man may be a Scribe, and a Phariſee; a Scribe by his Office, and a Phariſee by his Sect; as you may ſee, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.35. <hi>Then one of them,</hi> viz. of the Phariſees, <hi>which was a Lawyer, asked him a queſtion:</hi> A <hi>Lavvyer, i. e.</hi> a Scribe as <hi>Mark</hi> interprets it, chap. 12.28. And <hi>one of the Scribes,</hi> whom <hi>Matthew</hi> calleth <hi>one of the Phariſees.</hi> 2. <hi>Eſdras</hi> alſo was a Scribe, and no Phariſee. 3. It is commonly thought by Divines, that there was three ſorts of Scribes, Some about the King, which they prove from 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.17. <hi>Sariah was the Scribe,</hi> and 20.25. <hi>Sheva vvas Scribe,</hi> ſee 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 12.10. and 22.3. Others were Publick Notaries, as were <hi>the Kenites, that came of</hi> Hemath, <hi>the father of the Houſe of</hi> Rechab, 1 <hi>Chronicles,</hi> 2.25. who had no Heritage with the reſt of the Tribes, ſee <hi>Ier.</hi> 32.11. where yee ſee an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence drawn up by ſuch a Notary, and what was the cuſtome in drawing up of ſuch Evidences.

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:124638:15"/>read we, that <hi>Maachah</hi> the Kings Mother, who was puniſhed, was an Apoſtate. 5. Or thoſe that are mentioned in <hi>Eſdras,</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah.</hi> 6. Yea when the Kings, or people fell away to Idolatry, we never finde that they apoſtatized, for then they ſhould have been no more Gods people. 7. Only they joyned I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry with the ſervice of the true God; yea our Divines in diſputing againſt Papiſts, maintaine the Papiſts are Idolaters, for the adoration of Statues and Images; and that the people of the <hi>Iewes</hi> were not ſo mad, as to have ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined their Statues or Images to be true Gods: only they adored God in Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Statues, and the act of their Adoration <hi>terminative</hi> was related to God, and not to the Image, as that of the Papiſts. And as for your inſtance of <hi>Covetous</hi> Perſons; it is ridiculous, for <hi>covetouſneſſe</hi> is not properly Idolatry, ſuch as the Scripture ſpeaketh of in the Texts, which I produce; or ſuch as is comprehended in the ſecond Commandement, and is againſt God; but improperly, ſince it is not formally a breach of the Firſt, but of the Second Table. 2. Not formally and immediatly a ſinne againſt God, but againſt our Neighbour. Nor is the ſacrificing upon the High Places formally, and eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Idolatry. 1. For Idolatry is a ſinne againſt the ſecond Commandement, which is <hi>Iuris naturalis &amp; perpetui,</hi> but to ſacrifice upon High Places is not formally and eſſentially againſt any Commandement, that is <hi>Juris naturalis &amp; perpetui.</hi> 2. But only againſt a Poſitive, and temporall commandement of not ſacrificing in the high places; after that the Temple was built, whereunto God tyed the Religious act of ſacrifice. 3. Becauſe the Prohibitive Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement about ſacrificing upon High Places came long after the Second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement about Idolatry, viz. after that the Temple was built. Neither can <hi>M. S.</hi> bring any Text of Scripture for what he ſaith, viz. that only Apoſtates, or Idolaters, who enticed others to Idolatry, were to be puniſhed. 2. Howbeit they be to be puniſhed, yet others are not to be excluded from puniſhment. I pray the Reader to conſider, how tender-hearted this man is towards Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters and falſe Prophets; he pleadeth for them, as if he had a will to be one of them himſelfe: Neither in our Religion uſe we the rigour of this Law, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch as are not pertinacious, or who will repent of their ſinne: Our Churches deſire not the death of a ſinner, but of the ſinne; not of the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke or Schiſmatick, but of the Schiſme and Hereſie. We diſtinguiſh betwixt Hereſie, and Hereſie; Schiſme, and Schiſme; for ſome are of more, ſome of leſſe dangerous conſequence: Item betwixt Hereticks, and Hereticks; Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, and Schiſmaticks; for ſome are Ring-leaders, ſome miſled: ſome more, ſome leſſe pertinacious and malicious, &amp;c. and every one of them are to be puniſh't according to the quality of the Hereſie and Heretick, of the Schiſme and Schiſmatick. Sometimes alſo the Circumſtances of Times, Places, and Perſons are to be conſidered. And we are to doe what we may, and not what we may not:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>M. S.</hi> His eighth Anſwer (as if what he had ſaid were only to exerciſe
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:124638:16"/>his quick ſpirit, and to ſhew how cunningly he can elude ſtrong Arguments) is, That there are two reaſons why the Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> might be inveſted by God with a larger power in matters of Religion, then Kings and Magiſtrates under the Goſpel: 1. Becauſe their Kings were types of Chriſt, which ours are not: 2. And their People of the ſpirituall Church of Chriſt, and their Land of the Heavenly inheritance of that Church, which wee cannot claime.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A. S. Anſw.</hi> 1. To be a type of Chriſt, is not a ſufficient ground of a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticall power over the Church, or about the Church: For 1. then the Prieſts, and ſome Prophets, as <hi>Jonas,</hi> ſhould have had it: Yea, <hi>Adam, Iſaac,</hi> yea ſome other thing, as the Tree of Life, the firſt born of the Flock offered in Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice by <hi>Abel,</hi> the Paſchall Lambe, the brazen Serpent, all the Victimes of the Old Teſtament, the Ark and the Propitiatory: for they were all types of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe it hath no influence upon Civill Authority.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Becauſe it could not repreſent any Civill authority in Chriſt, ſince his Kingdome was not of this World.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It may be doubted how they were types of Chriſt, whether in reſpect of their Civill authority over the Church, or over the State, or otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It may be doubted if they were all types of Chriſt; as <hi>Athalia, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſeh, Ammon,</hi> who deſtroyed Gods ſervice, and the order of the Church; <hi>item, Herod,</hi> who perſecuted Chriſt, was ſure no type of Chriſt, and yet was King.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. If ſo, then the King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> of <hi>Syria,</hi> of the <hi>Philiſtims,</hi> yea the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> who domineered over them, were types of Chriſt. At leaſt, the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were not types of Chriſt, ſince they were all apoſtatized from the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall Law that ordained all the types: for a type, whether it be a thing, a perſon, perſons, action, effect, or event, it muſt ſignifie ſomething to come. 2. It muſt ſignifie, by Gods inſtitution or ordinance; and therefore neither was the Nazareate, or all the Nazarites types of Chriſt, as ſome Divines hold: 1. Becauſe the Nazareate was not a ceremony ordained by God, but volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily vowed. 2. Becauſe it prefigurated not Chriſt to come, or his benefits: and therefore, ſay they, Chriſt drank wine, and touched the dead: only they vowed it to bring under their fleſh, and for a pious exerciſe.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Howbeit they had been types of Chriſt in regard of their authority a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Church, yet will it not follow, that Chriſtian Princes cannot have it: for that which was typicall might be taken away, and that which was politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call may remaine.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. And I put the caſe, that the Iewes had received Chriſt, as abſolutely they might have done, who can doubt but their Politicall Government might have continued, and their Kings ruled as well the Church externally, as they did before his comming, ſince Chriſts Kingdome was not of this World, and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:124638:16"/>that he came not to aboliſh or to diminiſh the power of Kings, but to ſave their ſoules: they were no wayes loſers by Chriſts comming, but rather gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. He might as well have ſaid, they had a Civill power about the Church, becauſe they had their noſes betwixt their eyes. Many were types of Chriſt, that had not this authority about the Church; and many had this authority about the Church, who were not types of Chriſt: <hi>Ergo,</hi> this reaſon of his is falſe, and ridiculous.</p>
                  <p>No more were the people of the Iewes types of the Chriſtian Church, in reſpect of the Civill, but of the Spirituall and Eccleſiaſticall Government by Church-officers, and the People ſubject thereunto. So alſo was their Land a type of the Celeſtiall Hieruſalem, not as it conteined the State, but the Church; otherwiſe it ſhould have been a type of Heaven, before that the people of God had any right to it. And finally, types are not ordained by the Politicall or Morall Law, as Magiſtrates, and their Authority, (at leaſt, <hi>qua tales</hi>) but only by the Ceremoniall Law. True it is, that God may ſerve himſelfe of a thing inſtituted by the Morall Law to be a type, but he muſt make it a type by ſome ſubſequent Ceremoniall Law.</p>
                  <p>What he ſaith againſt all this, <hi>p.</hi> 52. §.23. that good Kings never oppreſſed godly perſons, when they were for a while tender in conſcience, it is not to the purpoſe. We only ſay here, that they may puniſh Idolaters, Seducers, Hereticks, and Sectaries; who are never ſuch, till they be ſufficiently convicted, and after that remain pertinacious: But no wayes good people, under the notion of good people, but ſo far forth as they doe amiſſe: And what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, if he who heretofore by the judgement of Charity was thought a good man, if he become an Heretick, or a Murtherer, ſhould not be puniſhed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Law, ſince the Magiſtrate puniſheth him not for his good, but for his ill?</p>
                  <p>§. 24. He ſaith, that I muſt prove that the Kings of Iudah had ſuch a power by a Morall law, which is of a perpetuall obligation and engagement upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations.</p>
                  <p>A.S. <hi>Anſw.</hi> It ſuffices, that I have proved it by a Politicall Law; and that the ſame reaſon obliges Chriſtian Princes, v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>A. S.</hi> I deny it: 1. For they exerciſed it alſo in beating downe of the High Places, wherein there was not Idolatry, as having been permitted before the building of the Temple. 2. Becauſe there is the ſame reaſon binding them, to exerciſe it againſt the tranſgreſſions of the firſt Commandement, the violation whereof is more directly againſt Gods Honour; for ſacrificing in High Places is but a circumſtance of the ſecond Commandement violated, but Hereſie and Schiſme are formall breaches of the firſt Commandement; the one of faith, the other of charity therein commanded, and the falſe Prophet was to be put to death. 2. In the ſame Section he ſaith, that it was the generality of the Church, or Nation of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and not their Kings that was inveſted with it by God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. and 7.5. and 12.2, 3.</p>

                     <hi>A. S.</hi> Here is Anabaptiſme in deveſting the Magiſtrate of his Power, and veſting the people with it. What? had every one the power of the Sword a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the people of the <hi>Iewes?</hi> 2. Was their Government Democraticall? or rather Anarchicall? Had women, children, and ſervants this Power? I grant you that in vertue of the Law, and their Covenant, they had all an hand in in the matter; but not abſolutely, but every man according to his Vocation: the King and Magiſtrate, as Judges, but the people only to execute accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their Commands. Neither is it credible, that when a falſe Prophet, or an Idolater was to be puniſhed, every one of the people was to judge him at his pleaſure, or to ſtone him to death. Neither containe theſe Paſſages, that you cite any ſuch thing, and therefore you did very cunningly not to quote the words themſelves, whereupon you ground this concluſion. And is this all the power and reſpect you give to the Parliament, and Civill Magiſtrate in Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall matters, even no more then to the meaneſt of the people? Truely they are much beholden to you for your great liberality: And if ſo, ride on in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite of King and Parliament to your beloved Conventicles.

                     <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Wherein the ſame Concluſion is further proved by Reaſons.</head>
                  <p>NOw after theſe Teſtimonies out of Holy Writ, I bring theſe Reaſons fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, grounded upon it: and 1. That power which the Civill Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate had in the old Teſtament, and is not abrogated in the New may yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:124638:17"/>in the <hi>New,</hi> or the Civill Magiſtrate may have it in the <hi>New.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the power to puniſh Hereticks, and Schiſmaticks is a Power, which the Civill Magiſtrate had in the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> and is not abrogated in the <hi>New Teſtament. Ergo</hi> the power to puniſh Hereticks, and Schiſmaticks, is a ſuch a Power he may Civill Magiſtrate may have in the <hi>New,</hi> and ſo in vertue of Power, which the puniſh them.</p>
                  <p>The Major is certaine, for there is no other true way to make it not to continue, but only the abrogation: As for the Minor, the firſt part of it is certaine, as appeareth by the Texts of Scripture already alleadged. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Part may eaſily be proved, becauſe only the Ceremoniall Law, which contained the ſhadow of things to come, was abrogated in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Morall Law was not abrogated ſo farre forth as it is a Rule of obedience, nor as it bindes us thereunto: No more is the Politicall Law in quality of Politicall; for by the ſame reaſon Chriſt ſhould have over-thrown and abrogated all the Politicall Lawes, and policies of the world. But that is falſe, for Chriſts Kingdome was not of this world; and he ſubmitteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe unto the Politicall Law of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> yea unto that of the <hi>Romans</hi> alſo, eſtabliſhed amongſt the <hi>Jewes:</hi> So did <hi>Paul</hi> and the Apoſtles, who pleaded their cauſes before Heathen Magiſtrates; I appeale unto <hi>Caeſar,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, Non auferet mortalia, qui regna dat Coeleſtia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Yea, if the <hi>Jewes</hi> had received Chriſt for their Meſſias, I doubt not but the Politicall Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> in quality of Politicall, ſhould have continued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, and the Civill Magiſtrate amongſt them ſhould have puniſhed Hereticks, Schiſmaticks, Idolaters, &amp;c. in the New Teſtament, as they did in the Old. Neither is there any reaſon, wherefore Chriſt, or his Apoſtles ſhould have hindred him by his Politicall power to maintaine the Chriſtian Religion in the New Teſtament, as before he did in the Old.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And it may be further confirmed, becauſe the greater the favours be, that the Civill Magiſtrate hath received of God in the New Teſtament then in the Old; ſo much the greater obligation is laid upon him by his Power, to maintaine Gods Cauſe, and Religion.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And the holier our Covenant is, and the further it ſurpaſſes the Old, ſo much the greater ſhould the Civill Magiſtrates care be, to maintaine it by his Civill Power.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. If it were not ſo, the State of the Church in regard of the Civill Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate ſhould be worſe in the New, then in the Old Teſtament; for then he maintained it by his Civill Power, and by the ſword; and now he doth it not, nor yet hath the power to doe it.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Is not this plaine Anabaptiſme, to approve the authority of the Civill Magiſtrate in the Old Teſtament, and to reject it in the New; for as the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts reject it wholly in the New Teſtament, ſo doe the Independents in part, yea in a great part, viz. in that, which concerneth the defence of the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:124638:18"/>Church in puniſhing Hereticks, Schiſmaticks, Idolaters, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. He who ſhould be a Nurſe, and a Tutor of the Church in the New Teſtament, ſhould defend her by all his power: But Kings and Princes, and good Magiſtrates ſhould be ſuch, as we may ſee in all the Examples heretofore alleadged, and in <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and <hi>Eſay</hi> 1.49.22. where it is promiſed that Kings ſhall be Nurſes of the Church.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. What if forraigne Princes would invade the Church of God? may not godly Princes in ſuch a caſe juſtly defend it, and repreſſe them by the ſword? wherefore then may they not doe the like to their owne Subjects, who will trouble her peace, and by ſo doing compell them to their duty?</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Doth not the Civill Magiſtrate this in <hi>New England?</hi> wherefore then may he not doe it in Old <hi>England,</hi> unleſſe forſooth the Majeſtaticall preſence of five or ſix Independent Miniſters here be capable to dazle, and diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance him here, whereas they receive all their luſtre and influence from him there, or that as Monkes and Friers yee plead <hi>pro immunitate Clericorum,</hi> or that the ridiculous thunder-bolts of Maſter <hi>Goodwins</hi> pretended Judgements of God, be capeable to daſh it all in pieces here?</p>
                  <p n="10">10. If the Civill Magiſtrate have not a ſufficient Power to puniſh Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Hereticks, and Schiſmaticks for Religion, then all the Roman Lawes in the <hi>Code</hi> made againſt Hereticks, and thoſe of this Kingdome made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Ieſuites, Monkes, and Prieſts, muſt be unjuſt; yea the Iudgements gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out againſt them ſince this Parliament begun are unjuſt; and if ſo, you would doe well to tell them of it: If we beleeve theſe <hi>American</hi> Chriſtians, the Parliaments Lawes are little leſſe then tyrannicall.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. That for which all Princes are commended in Scripture, that all good Princes ſhould doe; and for which they are diſcommended, that ſhould they not doe. But for puniſhing of Idolaters, Schiſmaticks, Hereticks, &amp;c. all Princes that did ſo in Scripture are commended, and for ſparing of them are diſcommended. <hi>Ergo</hi> all good Princes ſhould puniſh Hereticks, &amp;c. and not ſpare them. The Major is certaine, the Minor is ſufficiently proved by the Examples of all the good Kings of <hi>Juda,</hi> and of <hi>Iehu.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="12">12. They are bound to puniſh all ſuch, as trouble the peace of the State, <hi>Ergo</hi> they are likewiſe bound to puniſh ſuch as trouble the peace of the Church, for who ever troubleth the peace of the Chriſtian Church, troubleth alſo the peace of the State, when the State is Chriſtian.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. If the Civill Magiſtrate be not bound by his Office to puniſh Hereticks, Schiſmaticks, &amp;c. he is bound to tolerate them all; and ſo to tolerate all Independents, all Browniſts, Anabaptiſts, Familiſts, Socinians, &amp;c. yea ſome, who deny the Immortality of the Soule, that hold a generall Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of all Beaſts, as well as of men; yea of all, that ever have been ſince the Creation of the world, or ſhall be to the day of Iudgement: peradventure of Lice, Flyes, VVormes, &amp;c. and ſo he ſhall doe well to Licence the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:124638:18"/>Bookes of ſuch ſubjects, till Maſter <hi>Goodwin, alias M. S.</hi> reſute them; for he findes no other remedy in Gods Word, but to refute ſuch Bookes. If we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve this new Goſpeller, yee ſhall have in a ſhort time as many Religions as dayes, yea as houres in a yeare: yea without all doubt, I tremble to ſay it, (the Lord preſerve us from it) as many Gods as ever the <hi>Greakes,</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> had. Wherefore in the name of God take heed, yee all moſt Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Worthies of the two Houſes of Parliament, to this moſt damnable Tenet.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. Princes, Kings, and Iudges in Scripture are called Deliverers, or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours of the people, becauſe they defend the Church from her Oppreſſors, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 2.16. ſuch as be Hereticks, Schiſmaticks, &amp;c. If therefore yee be our Iudges, moſt Honourable, and worthy Senators, it is your part to defend Gods people, the Religion, which he hath eſtabliſhed in his Word, and to deſtroy Oppreſſors, and the Enemies thereof; I meane not their Bodies, but their Oppreſſions, their Hereſies and Schiſmes.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. Maſters have power to put Hereticks and Schiſmaticks out of their houſes, in caſe they be pertinacious; <hi>Ergo</hi> Princes and Magiſtrates have the ſame power in the State, for there is the ſame reaſon for both, viz. not to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer God to be offended ſo far forth as in us lyeth.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. What power is <hi>juris naturalis,</hi> is to be exerciſed in all times and places according to our power: But the power to puniſh Hereticks, &amp;c. is <hi>Iuris naturalis, Erge</hi> it is to be exerciſed in all times, and places. The firſt Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is certaine; for that which is <hi>juris naturalis</hi> changeth not, but is the ſame in all times and places, becauſe it is not grounded in any inconſtant or voluntary inſtitution of our will, but in the immutable ordinance of Nature, which dictates the ſame thing to all Perſons, in all times, and in all places. The ſecond I prove, becauſe it is a Dictate of the Law of Nature, that ſuch, as trouble the true Religion, are to be puniſhed; and <hi>Moſes</hi> gives you a naturall reaſon of it, viz. <hi>for they will turne thy heart away from the Lord thy God, Deut.</hi> 7.4. and 13.5. the reaſon will be thus: who ever in all Morall proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility will turne the peoples heart away from God, it is the Civill Magiſtrates duty to puniſh him. But Hereticks, &amp;c. are ſuch, <hi>Ergo</hi> it is the Civill Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates duty to puniſh them; it is <hi>Moſes</hi> argument.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. If the Civill Magiſtrate puniſh not Hereticks, he ſhould become a partaker of other mens ſins, becauſe he hindereth them not, ſo farre forth as in him lyeth by his Civill Power, viz. in puniſhing them: neither carrieth he the ſword in vaine; neither can it be better employed then in puniſhing pertinacious ſinners, ſuch as are Hereticks and Schiſmaticks: But he ſhould not become a partaker of other mens ſins, as the light of Nature, and Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teacheth us, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.22.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. If he puniſh not Hereticks, then every man in the Kingdome ſhall have power to mould himſelfe a new Religion, according to his owne heart, as the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:124638:19"/>Iſraelites did their golden Calfe, and doe what ſhould ſeeme right in his owne eyes. But the Conſequent is abſurd, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.8. Neither was it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted amongſt the Heathens themſelves, that any man ſhould bring in new Gods, or new Religions, by their owne private authority. We read how the <hi>Athenians</hi> ſentenced <hi>Diagoras, Anaxagoras,</hi> and <hi>Socrates</hi> for their new Opinions in matter of Religion; and <hi>Philaſtrius</hi> telleth us, how the <hi>Audiani</hi> were condemned for Hereticks, becauſe that they commended all Sects and Hereſies; why not alſo the Independents, for commending and defending the toleration of them all?</p>
                  <p n="19">19. Becauſe <hi>we pray to God for Kings, and for all that be in Authority; that we may lead a quiet and a peaceable life in all Godlineſſe and honeſty,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.2. By their converſion to Chriſt, v. 3, 4, 5. to the end, that being converted, they may defend Religion, in puniſhing Hereticks and Schiſmaticks, and ſo in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing of Schiſme and Hereſie.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. Becauſe in a State wherein all men profeſſe the truth, the peace of the State cannot be otherwayes preſerved; nor the ſafety of the Kingdome, which is the ultimate end of the Civill Magiſtrate, <hi>qua talis,</hi> and the ſupreme Law of the Republike be obtained: for how ſhall peace, ſafety, and unity be procured amongſt Orthodox Subjects, but by unity in Truth? and how can the bond of unity be any wayes ſo ſoon, and ſo eaſily broken, as by diverſity of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? And this the Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtory fully ſheweth us: for what miſeries cannot theſe Schiſmes breed; when the Husband is of one Religion, and the wife of another; the Father of one, and the Sonne of another; Brethren and Siſters of divers Religions; the King of one, and the Subjects of another? How many Families hath it diſſolved? how many Cities hath it deſtroyed? Have we not Examples freſh and bleeding before us in <hi>Ireland,</hi> &amp;c? It hath coſt ſome Kings their Crowns, ſome their lives, and endangered others of their life and Kingdome both. Yea, what is one of the principall cauſes of our preſent diviſions betwixt <hi>the King and the Subjects?</hi> Is not Arminianiſme, Socinianiſme, the Archiepiſcopall (I know not what) Religion? Some call it Popery, ſome Socinianiſme, others Arminianiſme, others Lutheraniſme, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſome mixture of Religion, not much unlike to Samaritaniſme. But be it what it will; diverſity of Religion, and not puniſhing of Hereticks and Schiſmaticks, is the principall cauſe of all theſe our miſeries and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. The Civill Magiſtrate is to puniſh ſuch as marry with thoſe of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Religion, and that becauſe they are of contrary Religions, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by the texts of Scripture already alleadged, [<hi>Deut.</hi> 7.2.3.] How much more thoſe, who <hi>are</hi> of contrary Religions? <hi>nam propter quod unumquodque tale, id magis tale:</hi> for it is a greater ſin to be an Idolater, or an Heretick, then to be married to them.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. Thoſe, with whom we cannot enter into Covenant, cannot be tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:124638:19"/>among us, but muſt be at leaſt exiled by the Civill Magiſtrate: for, to live amongſt us, they muſt, at leaſt, enter into Covenant with us for an offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and defenſive warre againſt forraigne Enemies:</p>
                  <p>But with Idolaters, Hereticks, &amp;c. we cannot enter into Covenant, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.2. ſo <hi>Eſdras</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> above quoted: <hi>Ergo,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="23">23. Becauſe God hath promiſed to deſtroy our Enemies, if we deſtroy his: wherefore, rather then God ſhould not deſtroy ours, were it not policie to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour the deſtruction of his?</p>
                  <p n="24">24. The man who will not hearken to the Miniſters of the Church, and the Civill Magiſtrate, the Civill Magiſtrate muſt puniſh him. But Hereticks and Schiſmaticks are the men, who will not hearken unto the Miniſters of the Church, and to the Civill Magiſtrate; <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Civill Magiſtrate muſt puniſh them. The firſt Propoſition is cleere: <hi>The man that will doe preſumptuouſly, and will not hearken unto the Prieſt, or unto the Judge, even that man ſhall dye, Deut.</hi> 12.12. Neither know I what can be anſwered, ſave only, that that muſt be underſtood of the Prieſt of the Old Teſtament. But there is the ſame reaſon for the Miniſters of the New Teſtament, viz. 1. The taking away of evill, the conſervation of order and unity, and to avoyd Schiſme. 2. Neither did Chriſt by his death obtaine for us an immunity from all obedience, or an independent licentiouſneſſe to doe ill. 3. And this is the Holy Ghoſts reaſon in that ſame place: <hi>And thou ſhalt put away the evill from Iſrael: And all the people ſhall heare, and feare, and doe no more preſumptuouſly,</hi> ver. 12.13. which obligeth us as well unto obedience under the New Teſtament, as thoſe of the Old Teſtament.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. So we have an Example of <hi>Corah, Dathan, Abiram,</hi> and <hi>On,</hi> who were <hi>Independents,</hi> and for their <hi>independency,</hi> and not ſubjection unto the <hi>authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative power</hi> of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> were ſeverely puniſhed by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed miſerably.</p>
                  <p>We might bring many reaſons of the Holy Ghoſt himſelfe, wherefore the Civill Magiſtrate muſt puniſh <hi>Idolaters, falſe Prophets,</hi> or Hereticks, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. Becauſe Gods people <hi>is an holy people to the Lord.</hi>

                  <p n="27">27. Becauſe they know that God is <hi>faithfull, and keepeth his Covenant, Deut.</hi> 7. and 13. Neither can any man blame ſuch Arguments, but thoſe who will blame the Holy Ghoſt his Arguments; for they are not mine, but His.</p>

                     <hi>M.S.</hi> then, p. 33. §. 2. argueth, 1. thus: By ſuch an umpirage and deciſion as this, between the Civill Magiſtrate, and himſelfe, viz. <hi>A.S.</hi> with his fellow Presbyters, hath he not made the one <hi>Judex,</hi> and the other <hi>Carnifex:</hi> the one, i. e. the <hi>Civill Magiſtrate,</hi> muſt give the ſentence; the other muſt doe execution.</p>
                  <p>Anſw. <hi>A.S.</hi> 1. There is no deciſion at all between the Civill Magiſtrate, and <hi>A. S.</hi> for <hi>A. S.</hi> is but a private man, neither Magiſtrate, nor Church-Officer. 2. Neither are the Presbyters his fellow-Presbyters, ſince he is no Presbyter: Theſe then, in the beginning, are manifeſt untruths. 3. Neither can this deciſion in granting an <hi>Intrinſecall povver,</hi> both <hi>directive</hi> and <hi>execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> to the <hi>Church;</hi> and an <hi>Extrinſecall</hi> to the <hi>Civill Magiſtrate,</hi> (viz. which is <hi>extrinſecall</hi> in reſpect of <hi>Eccleſiaſticall povver,</hi> but <hi>intrinſecall</hi> to <hi>Civill povver</hi>) make the <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Eccleſiaſticall Aſſembly</hi> a <hi>Judge,</hi> and the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> or <hi>Civill Magiſtrate</hi> a <hi>Hangman</hi> (to remember his moſt humble reſpects unto the King, Parliament, and all the Iudges of this Kingdome) For the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall Aſſemblies (as it is the common opinion of all our Divines) cannot judge of the Civill Magiſtrate his duty. 2. Neither have they ever been ſo fooliſh, as <hi>M. S.</hi> moſt paſſionately and impudently calumniateth them here, to command him any thing. 3. They acknowledge moſt willingly, that the Church, being materially a part of the State, is ſubject to Civill Government. 4. That the Church, which is the Kingdome of Chriſt, hath no Civill power, ſince it is not of this World, <hi>Joh.</hi> 18.26. 5. That the Civill Magiſtrate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding and compelling ſuch as be refractory and diſobedient to the Church, muſt not ſee with the Churches eyes, but with his own Civill or Politicall eyes. 6. And that in ſo doing he obeyeth not the Church, or any Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall power, but God, whoſe power he exerciſeth in the State, as the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall Aſſemblies doe exerciſe Chriſts power in the Church. 7. Yea more, that ſometimes the Civill Magiſtrate may not puniſh thoſe who are diſobedient to the Church, <hi>viz.</hi> if thereupon may follow the undoing of the State, &amp;c. 8. For the ſame reaſon, it is moſt untrue, that the one <hi>giveth out the ſentence, and the other muſt doe execution.</hi> 9. And moreover, becauſe they are two ſeverall Iudicatories, they are both independent one upon another, howſoever both divers wayes ſubject one to another: for the Civill Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate is ſubject in a ſpirituall way to the Church; He muſt learne Gods will by the Miniſters of the Church, who are Gods Ambaſſadours, ſent unto him: He muſt be ſubject unto Eccleſiaſticall Cenſures, as we ſee by the Examples of the Kings in the Old Teſtament, and <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Emperour in the New. So the Church againe is ſubject not in a Spirituall, but in a Civill way, to the Government of the Civill Magiſtrate, as all Proteſtants, and Miniſters them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves confeſſe, and plead for it againſt the Romane Clergie, in favour of the Civill Magiſtrate. 10. The Civill Magiſtrate hath power, not to receive into the State all that which the Church judgeth fitting: He may irreſiſtably hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:124638:20"/>it, if he will. 11. If he be <hi>Carnifex,</hi> becauſe that he commands it to be put in execution, he ſhould be <hi>Carnifex,</hi> when ever he ſhould command his own judgements to be put in execution 12. So ſhould Independents be <hi>Carnifices,</hi> when either the Civill Magiſtrate or the Church commands them to doe their duty. 13. The <hi>Carnifex</hi> or Executioner pronounceth not a ſentence as the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>M. S.</hi> Obj. 2. pag. 33. The Civill Magiſtrate is much beholding to the Presbyter, for giving him a Conſecrated ſword to fight the Presbiterian bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels; and for perſwading of him to pull out his own eyes, upon this preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he ſhall ſee better with his.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A. S.</hi> As able as this man is in jeering, and calumniating, as unable is he in arguing againſt this truth, eſpecially if he have no better arguments in his Budget by way of Reſerve, then what he brings here, all he ſaith is utterly falſe. 1. The Presbyterians have none but ſpirituall battels to fight; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.3, 4. the weapons of their warfare are not carnall. 2. They doe not warre after the fleſh; neither wraſtle they againſt fleſh and bloud, but againſt the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the darkneſſe of this world, againſt ſpirituall wickedneſſe in High Places; their ſword is the ſword of the ſpirit, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.12. And therefore they cannot, nor pretend they to give him this ſpirituall ſword; they cannot quit it: much leſſe can they give him the materiall ſword which is none of theirs to give, <hi>for he hath it of God; he is the Miniſter of God,</hi> Rom. 13.4. <hi>avenger,</hi> to execute wrath upon him that doth evill. 2. It is falſe, that the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> perſwade him to <hi>pull out his ovvn eyes,</hi> or to <hi>ſee vvith theirs.</hi> 1. For they teach him to learne the Goſpell, by reading the Word, and hearing it Preached by the Miniſters thereof, according to Gods Word, and not by every Cobler, as amongſt Independents in exerciſing their gifts. 2. And afterwards to ſee and judge by his owne eyes. 3. They ſay and Preach that it is a great ſin in him, if he judge with any other then his owne eyes. 4. He muſt judge according to the Lawes of the State; otherwiſe he doth not the part of a Iudge. 5. Yea if his judgement diſſent from the judgement of the Law, we know well enough <hi>he ought to quit</hi> both his owne judgement, and that of the Church, and to judge againſt his owne private conſcience according to the Law, and his pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick conſcience which he is bound to have, as a publick perſon, conforme to Law; for he ſitteth not upon the Tribunall as a private, but as a publick Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, not as <hi>Iames</hi> or <hi>Charles,</hi> but as King <hi>Iames,</hi> or King <hi>Charles.</hi> So in this there is no policy, as this malignant ſpirit calumniateth. I omit here his deepe policy in comparing the Civill Magiſtrate, 1. King, Parliament, &amp;c. with a <hi>Dogge.</hi> 2. And the <hi>Presbytery</hi> with an <hi>Ape:</hi> whether this be not prophanation, and impiety at leaſt, and that in a pretty high degree, I ſubmit to the judgement of thoſe whom it ſo nearely concerneth, if they be <hi>Apes</hi> I wonder you will call them Brethren. VVhat brother Ape, and ſo <hi>Apes</hi> your ſelves, according to your Tenet: ſo let the Concluſion hold for you; but we deny
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:124638:21"/>the Antecedent, in ſo far forth as applyed to Presbyterians.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>M. S. Obj.</hi> 3. Surely the frame and conſtitution of Presbyterie is exactly calculated for the Meridian of this preſent World: And indeed <hi>A. S.</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe is ſomewhat ingenuous, in acknowledging, that this Government hath little or no relation unto, or compliance with the World, which is to come; profeſſing, p. 13. the externall peace of the Church to be the adequate end thereof. The Argument will be thus:</p>
                  <p>That Government, whoſe adequate end is the externall peace of the Church, hath no compliance with the world to come, but is calculated for the Meridian of this world:</p>
                  <p>But Presbyterian Government is a Government, whoſe adequate end is the Externall peace of the Church, as <hi>A. S.</hi> confeſſeth, p. 13. <hi>Ergo:</hi> The Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Government hath no compliance, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.S.</hi> To be ſhort here; Note, when I ſay, that the peace of the Church is the adequate end of Church-Government; 1. That by the Church-Government, I meane not the Church, according to her eſſentiall, but to her accidentall or viſible forme: 2. And conſequently, that by Government I meane not the internall Government, which belongeth to her, in reſpect of her eſſentiall, but the externall, which belongeth to her, by reaſon of her acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall or viſible forme: the firſt is proper to Chriſt, or God in Chriſt, who only hath a domination over our ſoules. But the ſecond he exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeth by the Miniſtery of men. 3. That by the peace of the Church, I meane not a worldly, but a ſpirituall peace or quietneſſe, voyd of Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call trouble, by corruption of Doctrine, Diſcipline, or manners; for in the midſt of wordly troubles and perſecutions, this peace may be had; neither can there one word of all this be denyed, ſince our diſpute here is only about the viſible Church. 4. That by the word <hi>end</hi> I mean't not, 1. <hi>Finem ultimum ſimpliciter, ſed in ſuo genere,</hi> i. e. not the ultimate end abſolutely, but in its owne kind; nor 2. <hi>Finem operantis Artificis,</hi> or <hi>operis;</hi> but <hi>Artis &amp; Operatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis;</hi> not the end of the Agent, of the Artiſt, or of his worke; but of the Art or Habitude, whereby he operateth, and of his Operation. Nor 3. the <hi>exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall end</hi> of Government, ſuch as is the World to come, or eternall life; but the <hi>internall end,</hi> which is her peace and quietneſſe; which however it be an <hi>externall accident of the Churches Eſſence,</hi> yet it is the <hi>intrinſecall end of her externall Government.</hi> Nor, 4. the <hi>common end of Government,</hi> which is the end of other things alſo, as, <hi>the World to come;</hi> which is the end of our Faith, Charity, of all Chriſtian vertues, of Diſcipline and Government alſo, but the proper and particular end thereof. 5. <hi>Non finem obtinendum ſolum,</hi> but, <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducendum.</hi> And I could not, nor ſhould have taken it otherwiſe, as this man moſt impertinently would have me to doe: for things are defined, notified, and diſtinguiſhed by their internall, proper, ultimate ends in <hi>ſuo genere,</hi> and that are to be wrought; and not by their extrinſecall, common, abſolutely
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:124638:21"/>ultimate ends, &amp;c. as the Philoſophers doe teach us.</p>
                  <p>So I anſwer, that the Propoſition is falſe; for Church-Government may have the Externall peace of the Church for its adequate, Intrinſecall, proper, ultimate end, <hi>in ſno genere,</hi> and for the end of Government and Diſcipline, which is <hi>finis producendus;</hi> And the <hi>World to come,</hi> for its Extrinſecall, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, abſolutely ultimate end; for the end that is to be obteined, and end of the Agent, and of his worke.</p>
                  <p>And if it be objected, that the adequate end of Church-Government ſhould containe in it ſelfe all its ends, and conſequently the life to come. I anſwer, that that is moſt falſe, for it containeth only its partiall ends. 2. If it be the Internall end, it containeth not the Externall end thereof: If it be the proper end, it cannot containe the common end, but the common end containeth it: neither is it needfull that it containe the mediate and ultimate ends, or the ultimate abſolutely, and the ultimate in its own kind or ſort; for only it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth in it the partiall ends, ſuch as are not ſubordinate, as the mediate and ultimate end, or as the ultimate abſolutely, and in its own kind or ſort: And the reaſon of it is this; becauſe, as <hi>partes</hi> and <hi>compartes,</hi> ſo partiall ends are <hi>coordinate</hi> and oppoſed one to another, and not <hi>ſubordinate,</hi> as the mediate and ultimate end, or as the ultimate abſolutely, and in its own kind, as the Externall peace of the Church, and the VVorld to come.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 4. The ſum of <hi>M.S.</hi> his diſcourſe, p. 33. §. 5. and p. 34. commeth to this; If the civill Magiſtrate hath not a Directive power in the Church, but the Church-Aſſemblies have it alone; then the Church-Aſſembly muſt have the gift of Infallibility.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.S.</hi> This is a Papiſticall Argument, whereby the Ieſuites prove, that the Romiſh Church cannot erre: But I anſwer him, and Papiſts both.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. I deny this <hi>connexum:</hi> for a Directive power may be, where there is no infallibility. 2. The Independents arrogate to their Congregationall Churches and Presbyteries, a Directive power, without any gift of infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. 3. They grant a Directive power unto the Civill Magiſtrate, whom they grant to be fallible. 4. And howbeit the Civill Magiſtrate be fallible, yet they will not grant, that the Presbyterie may, or ſhould iudge over him; no more can the Civill Magiſtrate judge over the Presbyterie, however it be fallible. 5. For by the ſame reaſon, any man might judge them both, ſince they are both fallible. 6. Howbeit any Iudge, either Secular or Eccleſiaſticall, be fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, yet muſt they be obeyed, till judicially they be convicted of error; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe controverſies ſhould never be ended, ſince wee have no infallible Iudge or Iudgement in this life, unleſſe God extraordinarily ſhould reveale it to us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 5. After ſuch ſtuffe, as we have ſeen, <hi>M. S.</hi> p. 34. §. 2. gueſſes what I meane by a <hi>Directive power,</hi> and brings three acceptions of it, but all ſhort of what I meane: The firſt is, that it may ſignifie a liberty or power of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:124638:22"/>adviſing, and propoſing of what may be expedient to be done in matters of Religion, and for the good of the Church, which he would have to belong to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and all others. 2. An Authoritative power, to conclude, ſay, and ſet down what ſhall, muſt, or ought to be done (againſt all contradiction) in <hi>matters of Religion:</hi> and this he grants to God alone; and addeth; If the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> demand ſuch a <hi>Directive power,</hi> let them ask the Crown, Throne, and Kingdome of <hi>Chriſt</hi> alſo. To this, <hi>A. S.</hi> ſaith, that all men may grant it to be true, if they claimed any <hi>ſoveraigne, Royall authoritative power:</hi> But if they claime only a Miniſteriall power, it is as great a ſacrilege to deny them it, as blaſphemy in them to arrogate the other, ſince they are Gods Miniſters and Ambaſſadors for <hi>Chriſt.</hi> 3. A prudentiall faculty or ability to direct, order, or preſcribe, whether to a mans ſelfe, or to others, what in a way of reaſon, humane conjecture, or probability, is beſt and fitteſt to be done, followed, or imbraced in matters of Religion: and this he grants to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> to many private Members of particular Churches, and to <hi>Presbyteries</hi> and <hi>Synods</hi> alſo, howſoever with a reſtriction.</p>
                  <p>But in all theſe his Conjectures, he hath no waies gueſſed at my mind: for by a Directive power, however I meane a prudentiall Prudence, yet meane I not a private prudentiall Prudence, which may be found in Midwives, Maid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervants, and VVater-men; for in granting ſuch a Power to the Parliament and Eccleſiaſticall Senates, he grants them no more, then to the meaneſt of the people; but I meane an authoritative publick, and Eccleſiaſticall pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall power, not Soveraign, Imperiall, Royall, or Deſpoticall, or Magiſteriall; but Miniſteriall, ſuch as may belong to Miniſters, and Ambaſſadours of Chriſt: And as I have ſaid, it is not <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>Ob.</hi> 6. AFter all his gueſſing, ſo little to purpoſe, p. 35. §. 6. he endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to prove by the Ordinance of the Parliament for the calling of the Aſſembly, that the Civill Magiſtrate <hi>doth claime, yea and exerciſe, act, and make uſe of ſuch an authority from day to day, as occaſion requireth;</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Parliament publiſhed their Ordinance for calling the Aſſembly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A. S. Anſvv.</hi> I deny the conſequence, for that contrivance and publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of their Ordinance, is not a directive power, intrinſecall to the Church, whereof we ſpeake, for neither directs it them intrinſecally in Doctrine, Diſcipline or manners, but extrinſecally; 1. becauſe the Eccleſiaſticall Aſſembly may be, and hath ſundry times been convocated without it, as in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:124638:22"/>Church. 2. Becauſe it was before ever the Synod began, and without any Eccleſiaſticall act: Now what is before a Synod beginneth, and without any Eccleſiaſticall Act cannot be intrinſecall to the Synod, or to the Church. 3. Becauſe the Directive power, whereof I ſpeake, was in <hi>Iudging of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies of Religion, &amp;c.</hi> but the publiſhing of an Ordinance for calling the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, is no ſuch thing. <hi>Ergo,</hi> 4. Becauſe that calling of the Aſſembly by Civill Authority alone, was extraordinary, howbeit very juſt and conforme unto Gods Word. Neither could this be an Eccleſiaſticall Aſſembly, unleſſe it were vertually called by the Church Officers in vertue of their ſubſequent conſent thereunto: and all theſe Anſwers muſt be taken conjunctly, and not ſeverally. 5. Becauſe this Aſſembly is not Eccleſiaſticall in vertue of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Parliament, but of the virtuall conſent of the Church. The ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall indiction of it by Church Authority, contributeth to make it intrinſecally Eccleſiaſticall: But the Ordinance of the Parliament is extrinſecall unto it, in ſo farre forth as Eccleſiaſticall, howſoever it be very juſt and neceſſary: but it is intrinſecall to it accidentally, and in ſo farre as is to be received in the State, which abſolutely is extrinſecall to the Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob. M. S.</hi> In limiting thoſe, that were to be of the Aſſembly, to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect or Argument, on which it was permitted them to debate; they did no leſſe, <hi>i. e. they exerciſed a directive power.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A. S. Anſw.</hi> 1. But this is no intrinſecall directive power, whereof I ſpeake, viz. in Teaching, Preaching, judgeing of Controverſies of Religion, &amp;c. 2. This was no Eccleſiaſticall, but a Civill Power. 3. In ſo doing, the Parliament judged not what was to be beleeved or practiſed in the Church, but ordained them to judge, which is the true intrinſecall, directive power. 4. And this was extraordinary in reſpect of Gods <hi>particular,</hi> howbeit not in reſpect of his <hi>generall Providence</hi> in the Government of his Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>M. S. Ob.</hi> 8. In appointing and ordering them not to determine or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude of things, as they pleaſed, by Pluralities of Votes, <hi>but to deliver their Opinions and advices as ſhould be moſt agreeable to the Word of God</hi> (another proviſo in the Ordinance) they did the ſame.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.S.</hi> 1. <hi>M.S.</hi> would here ſeem to give ſome great power unto the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in matters of Religion, &amp; yet it is nothing elſe, but that, which he grants to too many private Members of particular Churches. So that if the King and Parliament will become Members of this <hi>M.</hi> S. his Church, and He pleaſe to admit them, it may be, that he will grant them as much power, as to other private Members thereof. 2. Note, that he ſaies not, that it <hi>belongs</hi> unto them, but, that they <hi>claime</hi> it, <hi>exerciſe, act,</hi> and <hi>make uſe of it;</hi> but <hi>quo jure, quave injuriâ,</hi> he telleth not. 3. In all this there appeareth no <hi>intrinſecall,</hi> or <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall Power,</hi> they did it not by a <hi>Spirituall,</hi> but by a <hi>Secular Power.</hi> 4. And if the Church had not a <hi>Spirituall</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſticall Power</hi> to determine; and to conclude, what needed the Parliament to forbid it the Synod, rather
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:124638:23"/>then ordinary Tradeſmen, who have no ſuch power to determine ſuch matters. 5. Neither by this command is it the <hi>Parliaments</hi> mind, as I beleeve, to take away from the <hi>Church</hi> the <hi>directive</hi> and <hi>intrinſecall Power,</hi> that God hath granted her, but only to deſire her to put off her <hi>Determinations,</hi> till it ſee how farre it can prevaile by faire meanes to gaine pertinacious men, who may op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e it; and happily alſo till it receive full ſatisfaction it ſelfe, before it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme ſuch <hi>Determinations</hi> by an Act of Parliament, and ſo make them to be received by their authority in the State; for the Parliament hath no leſſe Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill and Secular Authority to receive, or not receive it by a Civill Law into the ſtate, then any Synod hath ſpirituall authority to eſtabliſh, or not eſtabliſh it by an Eccleſiaſticall Law in the Church. Wherefore in this the Parliament intended not to croſſe the Church Government, nor to be croſſed in their Civill Government by the Church, as in former times, but to live together, as <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> both looking to one end, but each one of them with their owne eyes, the one with a Politicall, the other with a Spirituall or Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call eye. And this appeareth by thoſe words of the Ordinance, <hi>during this preſent Parliament, or untill further order be taken.</hi> Now, if this Order were full, what needed the Synod attend for a further Order? Neither is there any man of judgement, that can blame the Parliament in all this, yea howbeit it ſhould extraordinarily doe more in this extraordinarily miſerable eſtate of Religion, when now Sathan hath ſo manifeſt and palpable an entrance into the Church of God, under ſo many ill-portending ſhapes, as of Independents, Browniſts, Anabaptiſts, Socinians, &amp;c. they had need take upon them, for the defence of the Church, more then in ordinary caſes they doe. 7. Only I adde a word, viz. that theſe words <hi>(as they pleaſed by plurality of Votes)</hi> are not in the Ordinance, but are an addition of <hi>M. S.</hi> in contempt of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, as if the Members thereof voted not according to Scripture, but as <hi>pleaſed</hi> themſelves. And 8. that in caſe of <hi>difference</hi> in <hi>Opinion,</hi> it is not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, that they repreſent their Opinions, and the reaſons thereof, to either or both the Houſes, to the end that they may judge of the matter, but that they may finde out ſome further direction, whereby the Aſſembly may judge it. 9. Yea there is another Ordinance ſince the printed Ordinance, whereby it is ordained, that all things agreed upon and prepared for the Parliament ſhould be openly read, and allowed in the Aſſembly, and then offered, as the judgement of the Aſſembly, if the Major part conſent: ſee how the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Major part of the Aſſembly is here declared by the Parliament, to be acknowledged, as the Deciſion of the Aſſembly, which <hi>M. S.</hi> will not ſtand unto.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 9. In enjoyning them, <hi>in caſe of difference of opinions between them, to preſent the ſame, together with the reaſons thereof, to both Houſes;</hi> they did every whit as much.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.S. Anſw.</hi> 1. I deny that they who enjoyne, in caſe of difference, &amp;c. have
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:124638:23"/>an Internall power in the Church, much leſſe an internall Directive power. 2. This injunctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was not in reference to the Intrinſecal power of the Church, which is evermore within the Church; but to the Extrinſecall power about the Church, i.e. to that of the Magiſtrate, whoſe power is without the Church, howſoever within the State; and in ſo far forth as the <hi>Parliament,</hi> by Civill Law, intended to approve and confirme the Eccleſiaſticall Law. 3. <hi>Item,</hi> it was to ſee, if by any meanes and wayes of meekneſſe, it could perſwade a few men of your Sect to ſubmit themſelves unto the Order and Government that God hath eſtabliſhed in his Church; as they have done you many other favours, which you too much undervalue, arguing from this favour, as from a Law, to that which is, or ſhould be ordinary Iuſtice. And yet they ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that what is caried by plurality of Votes in the Aſſembly, ſhould paſſe as the judgement of the whole Aſſembly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 10. <hi>M.S.</hi> In their nominating and calling ſuch and ſuch Miniſters, and not others, to be of the Aſſembly, they acted the ſame power.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.S. Anſw.</hi> That is alſo Extrinſecall, ſince it was not in, but out of, and before the Aſſembly. 2. And extraordinary. 3. And yet very ordinate and ordinary for this extraordinary ſtate of the Church in this Kingdome, when ſuch a ſwarme of Sects are crept in; ſome comming from <hi>New England,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers from the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> and others from other places: For, if every one of them ſhould have had entry into the Aſſembly, what ſhould have become of us? 4. Neither doth this prove any Directive power in the Church, in teaching, &amp;c. (as I ſaid) that ſhould belong unto the Magiſtrate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>M.S. Ob.</hi> 11. In framing the temper and conſtitution of the Aſſembly, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying it with ſuch and ſuch Members of their own, they ſteered the ſame courſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.S. Anſw.</hi> 1. This cannot conclude any Directive, Eccleſiaſticall power that belongeth unto the <hi>Parliament.</hi> 2. Theſe Members of their own, who did ſit in the <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> if they had any Vote, did not ſit there in quality of Members of the <hi>Aſſembly;</hi> for then every Member of the <hi>Parliament</hi> might have ſate there: but in quality of extraordinary Eccleſiaſticall perſons, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this extraordinary ſtate and exigence of the Church. 3. If they had no Vote at all, and yet ſate, they were not Members of the <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> but this was a ſpeciall priviledge granted unto the Members of the Houſe, which in other places likewiſe is granted unto perſons of meaner rank, yea unto Strangers, as we may ſee in the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in their Generall Aſſemblies. 4. Or rather they ſit there in name of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> to procure by their Civill power, the Externall order that ſhould be in ſuch Aſſemblies: But this is no Eccleſiaſticall or Internall power in the Church, but Externall about the Church, ſuch as the <hi>French Kings Commiſſioners</hi> (who are ſometimes Papiſts) have in our Proteſtant Nationall Synods in <hi>France,</hi> and yet are not Members of our Synods there, neither Vote they, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:124638:24"/>pretend they to have any Intrinſecall power there; for then they ſhould profeſſe themſelves thereby to be Proteſtants; only they have power to oppoſe things, that they beleeve to be prejudiciall to the King or the State. 5. Neither beleeve I, that they vote in points of Doctrine. 6. And if they vote in matter of Government, they doe it in quality of Ruling Elders, either extraordinary or ordinary, in vertue of ſome virtuall election made by the Synod, or by the Synods toleration, or approbation; for no man can rule the Church intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecally, but he that is intrinſecally a Church-Ruler or Officer, as I have proved it heretofore.</p>

                     <hi>A.S.

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:124638:24"/>Accuſers (the Brethren ye know of) are more in number then they, and will needs continue Adverſaries to them?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.S. Anſw.</hi> 1. Though yee vaunt evermore of your ſufferings, we have never ſeen them. 2. Theſe, whom ye unjuſtly call your Adverſaries, have ſuffered much more then you, and yet publiſh it not unto the World. 3. It is abſolutely falſe, that ye ſuffer. 4. And yet much falſer, that ye ſuffer as men convicted. 5. And yet falſer, that ye ſuffer, becauſe your Adverſaries are more in number. And 6. falſeſt of all, that only ye ſuffer for that. 7. Men that ſuffer are not honoured, as ye are, neither receive they ſo great favours, Preſents, and Benefices, as ye doe. 8. It is a great ſufferance to the Church of God, to be calumniated and upbraided by ſo contemptible a number of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and to ſee ſo many Libels printed againſt her by thoſe of your Sect. 9. It is falſe, that ye are not condemned: for the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and all other Proteſtant Churches, in approving the Presbyterian Government, as we ſaid heretofore, could not but diſprove and condemne you all, who condemn it. 10. Neither doth all this prove a Directive Eccleſiaſticall power, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Civill Magiſtrate. 11. Ye have no Adverſaries here, but your Falſe Opinions. 12. Neither are your Brethren Adverſaries to you, but to your erronions Opinions, which are a thouſand times more your Adverſaries then they. 13. And both ye, and any of us, muſt legally ſuffer according to our demerits, when we are ſufficiently convicted and condemned by plurality of Votes, <hi>in foro externo,</hi> as ye are already, in very many things: for this is the way of all Civill and Eccleſiaſticall Judicatories; Neither can Independents change it.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. <hi>Ibid. M.S.</hi> reaſoneth thus: If our Saviours teſtimony concerning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, in his own cauſe, was not valid; how much leſſe the teſtimony of any other, yea of a thouſand, in any matter, that concerneth themſelves, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently that of our Brethren in the Synod? But the firſt is true, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.31. <hi>If I beare witneſſe of my ſelfe, my witneſſe is not true,</hi> i. e. it is not in a formall and Legall interpretation true, but you may reaſonably wave it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.S. Anſ.</hi> 1. Either <hi>Chriſt</hi> here ſpeaking of his own teſtimony, ſpeaketh of himſelfe according to his Divine, to his Humane, or according to both his Natures. Item, 2. Either he ſpeaketh of its validity in it ſelfe, or in reſpect of the Iewes, to whom he did ſpeak, and who ſhould have admitted of it. Item, 3. Either of his publique and judiciall, or of his private teſtimony:
<list>
                        <item>1. If in the firſt Propoſition we take our Saviour according to his Divine nature, or according to both, viz. as Mediator, the Aſſumption is falſe; for there <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſpeaketh not of himſelfe according to his Divine Nature, or to both, or as Mediator; for under that notion he is Iudge of quick and dead: and <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſayes, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8.14. that <hi>if he teſtifie of himſelfe, his teſtimony is true.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. Or if he ſpeak of himſelfe under this notion, then he ſpeaketh not of his teſtimony, as it is in it ſelf, but as it is in reſpect of them, who received
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:124638:25"/>it not, viz the Iewes, and unbeleevers, who received it not as the teſtimony of God, or of the Mediator, (however it was ſuch) for they knew him not, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8.15.19. but <hi>they judged according to the fleſh neither knew they him, nor his Father:</hi> And if they had known the King of Glory, they had never crucified him. And then the Propoſition is falſe: for it followeth not, that if <hi>Chriſts</hi> teſtimony, who is <hi>God,</hi> was not acknowledged as valid by thoſe who knew it not; <hi>Ergo,</hi> the teſtimony of a Presbytery or Synod ſhould not be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by ſuch as are ſubject thereunto, and know it: for by the ſame reaſon, two or three idle fellowes ſhould not beleeve the teſtimony of your Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery or Aſſembly.</item>
                        <item>3. I retort then the Argument:
<list>
                              <item>If <hi>Chriſts</hi> teſtimony was not legally valid in his own cauſe; <hi>Ergo,</hi> Yours, in your Presbyteries and Aſſemblies, is not legally true, or valid in your own cauſe, when ye judge in matters of Faith and and Diſcipline,</item>
                              <item>But the firſt is true: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the ſecond alſo.</item>

                        </item>
                        <item>4. If Chriſt be here taken according to his Humane Nature; then either he is taken according to his Humane nature, as it is in it ſelfe without ſinne, or as it was in the Phariſes eſtimation. If in the firſt way, the Aſſumption is falſe; for there the Phariſes took Chriſt for a ſinfull man: and who can deny, but that the teſtimony of a man, in the ſtate of integrity, is valid?</item>
                        <item>5. If it be taken in the ſecond way, I deny the firſt Propoſition for the teſtimony of Iudges, in judging according to Law, in things that concerne not ſo much their perſons, as the Society that they repreſent in judgement, as the <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> and all Eccleſiaſticall Iudges doe, is to be preferred before the teſtimony of any particular man.</item>
                        <item>6. And if this Maxime of the Independents hold, the judgement of no Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill Magiſtrate yea not of the <hi>Parliament</hi> it ſelfe ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

They who are Party, cannot be their Parties Judge, ſince they are all equals, <hi>Et par in parem non habet imperium;</hi> and to be both Iudge, and Party in one cauſe, cannot be granted to thoſe, that have no authoritative power one over another, as <hi>A.S.</hi> himſelfe affirmes.

                  <p>
                     <hi>A. S. Anſ.</hi> A Party cannot judge a Party; I diſtinguiſh, for either this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is only pretended, and ſo I deny the Major; or reall; and then this reall Party either compeareth in ſome perſonall, or reall actions of his owne alone; or in ſome cauſe of publick concernment: if he compeare under the firſt noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Major is true, but the Minor is falſe; for the Members of the Aſſembly compeare not in the Aſſembly for any perſonall or reall action of their owne alone, or of particular concernment: if he compeareth under the ſecond no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Major is falſe, unleſſe yee have ſufficient cauſe to forſake him for Iudge. 2. <hi>Item,</hi> If it be a Party, that hath no power over the Party in ſuch a cauſe, the Major is true, but the Minor is falſe; for the Aſſembly in matters of Diſcipline hath power over all the Independents in England, viz. to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne their Tenets according to Gods VVord: If it be a party, that hath po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer over the Party in ſuch a cauſe, as a Iudge, the Major is falſe, and ſo it was reaſoned, and this your Tenet judged, and condemned in the Arminians, as I hope, it ſhall be in this Arminian and the Independents, in this Aſſembly. 3. It is falſe that parties are equals, when the one hath power over ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; or when the one, that is pretended to be party, judgeth not in a matter concerning himſelfe, but the publick. 4. For if that ſhould hold, the parties of the Independent Churches might reject the judgement of whole Churches, yea of all the Churches of the world, pretending them to be parties. 5. Yea for the ſame reaſon they might reject the Iudgement of the Parliament. 6. This Argument proveth not the queſtion, viz. that the Parliament hath an intrinſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, directive power in matters of Religion, or an Eccleſiaſticall power, to judge in matters of Religion. 7. It is a very proud and Independent expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of yours, when you ſay, that the Synod and all the Churches in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian world are but the Apologiſts equals; you will finde them, I hope in God, their Judges; and yet they are put in authority by the Parliament, to repreſent the whole Church of England, which is more then ſuch an inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable number of Independents.</p>

If by <hi>peremptoriouſneſſe</hi> of <hi>Vote,</hi> he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth <hi>Plurality of Votes,</hi> I deny the <hi>conſequence</hi> or <hi>connexion;</hi> for when things are fully ballanced by reaſon, in any Aſſembly, it is more probable, that that is moſt true, that is carried by <hi>plurality of votes,</hi> and that <hi>Geometricall proportion,</hi> wherein conſiſteth <hi>diſtributive Iuſtice,</hi> may be more eaſily found out by <hi>Plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of votes,</hi> then by fewer votes; otherwiſe it were a folly to vote any thing; for wherefore vote they any thing in any Aſſemblies, but that it may be judged by <hi>plurality of votes?</hi> 3. And the Apoſtle willeth, that the ſpirit of Prophets be ſubject to the Prophets: Neither is it credible, that the Major part will ſubmit unto the leſſer part. 4. And we would willingly know of you, Sir, how things are ordinarily carried in your Aſſemblies? whether things being debated, and every mans Reaſons heard, the Major part ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth to the leſſer, or the leſſer to the Major? or whether that is thought truth, that the Major or Minor part Voteth? 5. If by <hi>peremptoriouſneſſe</hi> of <hi>votes,</hi> you mean a bold and imperious carrying of things by <hi>plurality of votes,</hi>
                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:124638:26"/>without reaſon, I ſhall readily grant you ſuch Aſſemblies are unlawfull; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any ſuch eſtabliſhed amongſt us; neither hath the Parliament eſtabliſhed any ſuch Eccleſiaſticall Aſſembly here; neither doth the Aſſembly arrogate unto it ſelfe any ſuch unjuſt power: if this Argument hold, it ſhall beate downe as well the proceedings of the Parliament; and all Civill Iudica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, wherein things are carried by <hi>Plurality of votes,</hi> as thoſe of the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly: wherefore all the Civill Powers in the world will doe well to take notice of this <hi>peremptorious cenſure</hi> of them all; for if it ſtand, they muſt fall and doe homage to the <hi>Independent</hi> Churches. Beſides this, I know not what he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth by <hi>Arithmetically priviledged;</hi> for it is no terme either in Divinity, or in Lawes, or in Philoſophy, for any thing I know: Neither heard I ever before of any <hi>Arithmeticall priviledge.</hi>

I diſtinguiſh the word <hi>judge,</hi> for either it ſignifies an <hi>Officiall, Publicke, Miniſteriall,</hi> and <hi>authoritative judgement;</hi> or a <hi>private common judgement</hi> of <hi>diſcretion,</hi> ſuch as belongeth to <hi>women,</hi> and all Chriſtians: if the firſt, the Minor is falſe; for what neceſſity can lye upon every private man, yea, Water-men, Coblers, and Oyſter-women to goe to the Aſſembly, and judge between the Apologiſts and them? If ſo, the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath done them wrong, in not calling of them, or rather in excluding them from ſo noble and neceſſary acts of their <hi>calling.</hi> And here I muſt pray the Parliament to conſider, whether this Doctrine of his in this point be not ſeditious, and ſufficient to excitate the ignorant people to challenge ſuch a pretended <hi>calling</hi> and liberty, or licentiouſneſſe of judgement? If every one be a Iudge to Rule, who ſhall be ruled? If every one command, who ſhall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey? how then hath the Apoſtle diſtinguiſhed Rulers from others?

                     <hi>A.S. Anſw.</hi> I deny the Conſequence of the <hi>firſt Propoſition:</hi> for to <hi>ſing obedience</hi> to the <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> it is not needfull, that one be Iudge betwixt them and the <hi>Independents;</hi> but, that they know whether the Iudgement of the <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly</hi> be juſt, or not, or rather, whether their Obedience be juſt, or not: for the <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> and they who have power to judge, may judge juſtly; and he who is judged, juſtly diſobey: as, if a man ſhould legally, <hi>in foro Externo,</hi> be convicted of Hereſie, or any other crime, the fact being proved by falſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and he afterwards condemned to acknowledge an Hereſie or crime; both the judgement ſhould be juſt, for the Iudges judged juſtly, <hi>juxta alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gata &amp; probata;</hi> but the Obedience to ſuch a judgement ſhould be unjuſt, and his diſobedience juſt; for he ſhould ſinne grievouſly againſt God, and give offence to his Neighbour, in acknowledging an Hereſie, or a filthy crime, where there is none at all. 2. By a <hi>calling</hi> to <hi>judge,</hi> either he underſtands a <hi>publike</hi> and <hi>particular calling</hi> to judge <hi>authoritativè,</hi> in conſulting in Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall Aſſemblies of matters of Religion, and deciding them, and ſo indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing an obligation unto obedience; or a <hi>common</hi> and <hi>private calling,</hi> out of Eccleſiaſticall Aſſemblies, by himſelfe alone, or in private with a friend, to

                     <hi>judge</hi> by a <hi>judgement</hi> of <hi>diſcretion,</hi> which induceth no bond or obligation to <hi>obedience.</hi> If by a <hi>Calling</hi> he meane the firſt, the firſt <hi>Propoſition</hi> is falſe; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will all the Independents, Arminians, Anabaptiſts, and Socinians ever be able to prove it. If the ſecond, all the Argument may be granted, viz. That the <hi>meaneſt</hi> of <hi>men</hi> have a <hi>common calling</hi> to <hi>judge</hi> by <hi>judgement of Diſcretion,</hi> (which induceth no <hi>obligation</hi>) betwixt the Synod, and the Independents: but that is not the Queſtion in debate. 3. I diſtinguiſh the word <hi>obedience</hi> and ſubmiſſion; for either this <hi>obedience</hi> is <hi>activè,</hi> when we are commanded by our Superiours, to be Agents or Actors in any thing, as to bow before an Idol, or Religiouſly to adore Altars, the Bread and Wine at the Lords Table, &amp;c. Or <hi>permiſſivè,</hi> when I am not commanded to be an Actor, or to doe any thing, but to permit it, not hinder it, or not oppoſe it, if I doe it not my ſelf; as when men are exhorted, or commanded to aſſiſt the poore; if I will not aſſiſt them, I am bound not to oppoſe the Command, or to hinder others from doing it: ſo, if a Miniſter preach not according to my palate, whatever be my private judgment of him, as if he preach too ſublimely, too ſpeculatively, leſſe methodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, &amp;c. yet muſt I let him alone, I may not oppoſe or croſſe him, becauſe that I have no <hi>publike calling</hi> to <hi>cenſure</hi> or hinder him. If <hi>obedience</hi> be taken in the firſt way, the firſt <hi>Propoſition</hi> is falſe; for every man in <hi>obeying actively,</hi> or when he is an Actor, muſt know whether he doth well, or ill, at leaſt by a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular judgement: if in the <hi>ſecond,</hi> it is true, that men are bound ſometimes to <hi>ſing</hi> a <hi>permiſſive obedience,</hi> without their <hi>underſtanding,</hi> becauſe in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they doe nothing themſelves, but permit other men to doe; as when there is a Miniſter called by the Church to <hi>preach,</hi> it may be, that ſome ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Mechanick will judge his Sermons to be too ſublime, more ſpeculative then practicall, happily alſo he will think them not methodicall: in ſuch a caſe the Mechanick hath no power to hinder the Preacher from preaching, or preaching ſo; he muſt obey in permitting, and not oppoſing him in preaching; for what is unſavory to his palate, is ſavory to anothers. 4. If this Argument hold, it ſhall preſſe no leſſe the Parliament, then the Aſſembly: for I put the caſe that the Aſſembly judge, and that all the Aſſembly and Independents goe one way, and the Parliament another, which, I truſt in God, ſhall never happen: I frame the Argument thus:</p>
                  <p>If the <hi>meaneſt</hi> of <hi>men</hi> have not a <hi>calling</hi> to <hi>judge</hi> betwixt the <hi>Parliament</hi> and the <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> then they muſt <hi>ſing obedience</hi> and ſubmiſſion to the Parliament, <hi>without their underſtanding.</hi> But the Conſequent is falſe; <hi>Ergo,</hi> And ſo your Independents ſhall neither obey Parliament nor Aſſembly.

If he meane the ſupreame power proper to Chriſt, we neither deſire him to beleeve, nor beleeve we, that Chriſt hath diveſted, or could diveſt himſelfe of it, to give it to the Church, for he kept to himſelfe, his owne ſupreame or Royall Power; but gave unto his Miniſters ſubalterne, and Miniſteriall power, which dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gateth no waies from his Royall power, ſince this is ſubordinate unto that.
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:124638:29"/>3. However he takes it, this Argument is captious, and is nothing elſe but a plain <hi>petitio principii,</hi> and proving the ſame thing by the ſame, or a Concluſion by a Premiſſe, as uncertaine as it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>After this petty Argument he maketh his Teſtament, reſolving himſelfe to dye a Martyr, amongſt good men, whom he hath moſt highly offended, and who profeſſe, that they compell no man to profeſſe any truth, much leſſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth, againſt the light of their Conſcience; how ridiculous a Martyr is this? They profeſſe that they may undergoe a voluntary exile, for feare of perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: if you, ſir, feare any ſuch thing, you may be gone, according to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of your owne Divinity.

But if a few men differ in their judgements from all the reſt of the Church, or will needs bring in new Religions, or novelties, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the common Tenets of the Church: then indeed they will caſt them out of the Church, or excommunicate them according to their demerits, neither is it equitable that they abide in a Church, or enjoy a Church conſociation, who will not ſubmit unto her Iudgement and Diſcipline. Neither will his Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que Eccleſian Miniſters admit unto, or receive any man into their Church, who differs in judgement from them, or who will not ſubmit unto their judgement: But howbeit the Church compell you not to ſubſcribe; yet the Civill Magiſtrate, after ſufficient conviction, may compell you to ſubſcribe, or to be gone; for after ſufficient conviction, Morally, it is, and ſhould be ſuppoſed, that yee know the Truth, or ſhould know it; or if yee know it not, that nothing can have hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred you, but your owne pertinaciouſneſſe, which cannot excuſe, but rather now accuſes, and aggravates your ſinne, ſince one ſinne, formally, and <hi>per ſe,</hi> cannot excuſe another; Neither have our Churches ever gone further, as may appeare by our Confeſſions of Faith, and Covenants of the Churches of Scotland, France, the Netherlands, Geneva, &amp;c.</p>

In his Office he is not ſubordinate or Vicegerent unto Chriſt, as Chriſt, but as God; not in his Royall or <hi>Divine office</hi> whereby he ruleth his <hi>Church;</hi> but in his <hi>Divine Nature</hi> or Power whereby he ruleth the <hi>World:</hi> not in his <hi>particular Providence</hi> about his <hi>Saints,</hi> but in his <hi>generall</hi> about <hi>all men</hi> and <hi>States:</hi> not according to the Covenant of <hi>Grace,</hi> if he be conſidered only as a Magiſtrate; for then, only they, who are in this Covenant, ſhould be Magiſtrates; but of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> for if <hi>Adam</hi> had continued in the ſtate of <hi>innocencie,</hi> we ſhould have had <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> without any <hi>Mediator,</hi> or <hi>Covenant of Grace.

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.S. Anſw.</hi> 1. I anſwer to your Propoſition, that in the ſame way the Civill Magiſtrate hath power to judge, or a Directive power in matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he hath power to command. Now his power to command, (as I have ſaid, is only Politicall, Civill, and Extrinſecall; <hi>Ergo,</hi> ſuch alſo muſt be his power to judge, or Directive power in matters of Religion, viz. Civill, Politicall, and Extrinſecall to the Church, howſoever Intrinſecall to the State: for as he hath a Civill, Royall, Imperiall, or Ariſtocraticall power to <hi>command,</hi> ſo hath he a Civill, Royall, Imperiall, or Ariſtocraticall power, &amp;c. to <hi>judge,</hi> and to direct him in his Commands, unleſſe he command without judgement: But I deny, that this concludeth, that he hath any Eccleſiaſticall or Spirituall power that is Intrinſecall to the Church, or Church-Officers, who governe the Church. 2. This Argument concludeth not an Executive power, which is the Title of the Chapter, and that which he intendeth to prove. This is like to <hi>Montagnes</hi> Diſcourſes, who ſundry times hath one thing in the Title, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other in the Chapter.</p>

                     <hi>M. S. Obj.</hi> 27. p. 44. <hi>ſect.</hi> 7. §. 3. being put in forme, will be thus:</p>
                  <p>They, who may determine, and judge amiſſe, ſhould not compell, or make the people, under their Government, to ſweare obedience or ſubjection unto their Orders, which yet, by your owne confeſſion, they doe:</p>
                  <p>But your <hi>Presbyteriall Aſſembly</hi> may determine and judge amiſſe, <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.S. Anſw.</hi> 1. The Propoſition is falſe. 2. Or if it be true, I ſubſume, But the Civill Magiſtrate, both in Eccleſiaſticall, and State matters, may judge amiſſe; <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Civill Magiſtrate ſhould not compell the people under his
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:124638:31"/>obedience unto his Order; <hi>Ergo,</hi> the <hi>Parliament</hi> ſhould not compell, or make any man to ſweare the <hi>Covenant; Ergo,</hi> The <hi>Independents</hi> ſhould not have taken the <hi>Covenant,</hi> becauſe that the <hi>Parliament</hi> might determine and judge amiſſe. 3. By this reaſon, a man muſt be tolerated in rejecting all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions or Faith, becauſe they, who contrive them, may erre. 4. In <hi>New-England,</hi> ſince they may erre, they can compell no man to your Religion, but muſt tolerate them, which ye will never grant. 5. I deny the <hi>Aſſumption,</hi> 1. For our Churches compell not the people to ſweare obedience or ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto their Order; for, Compulſion is <hi>a principio externo, contra inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem agentis;</hi> it proceedeth from an Externall principle, againſt the Naturall inclination of the Agent, viz. that is compelled to produce the action, and ſo is exerciſed only againſt the Body, over which the Church taketh no autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but the Civill Magiſtrate alone. 2. Neither ſaid I, to my knowledge, any ſuch thing. 3. Neither cite you the place. 4. Only I remember, that in my <hi>Obſervations</hi> and <hi>Annotations</hi> upon the <hi>Apologie,</hi> p. 39. §. 4 I ſaid, That <hi>the combined Elderſhip, having an Authoritative power, all men, and Churches thereof, are bound by Law and Covenant to ſubmit themſelves thereunto,</hi> viz. in a Spirituall manner, ſince the power is Spirituall. Never a word here of <hi>compulſion</hi> or violence. Our Churches neither compell mens bodies, nor have they any Priſons, or any pecuniary mulcts: but if any man will trouble the Church, and be diſobedient, it is the duty of the Chriſtian Civill Magiſtrate to uſe his power, to hinder ſuch a diſorder. If we have not a Chriſtian, and an Orthodox Magiſtrate in ſome places, as in <hi>France,</hi> and in ſome parts of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many;</hi> or if the Chriſtian Magiſtrate will not doe his duty, he who will not ſubmit unto our Church-Government, is caſt out, and puniſhed Spiritually, by ſimple Cenſure, Suſpenſion, or Excommunication, according to the quality of his ſin. 5. Learne alſo, I pray you, <hi>M.S.</hi> that it is not fallibility, but actuall failing, or ignorance, that may excuſe him, who is ſubject unto any Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Authority, from obedience: Nor yet all failing in judgement or error, but only that which is antecedent to all the acts of our Will, which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally we cannot ſhun, and is invincible. 6. Neither is it evermore expedient, that Subjects know certainly, whether their Governours judge, or doe right, in what they doe; for Subjects, in ſome caſes, muſt obey, in virtue of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable knowledge, or conjecture, that their Governours command juſtly; and eſpecially, when they are not compelled to be Actors in that, which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve to be unlawfull for them to doe. For I put the caſe, that the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament</hi> take a reſolution to make War againſt any Foraigne Prince, and preſſe ſome men to ſerve in ſuch a War, It is not for every preſſed man to call the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament</hi> to an account, about the equity of the War, neither are they bound to diſcover to every Souldier all the ſecrets and particulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of State thereupon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>M.S. Ob.</hi> 28. Why are you not ſatisfied with that ſubjection to your Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterial
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:124638:31"/>Deciſions, that pleadeth no exemption, but only in caſe of non-ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction about the lawfulneſſe or truth of them?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.S. Anſ.</hi> 1. We are content with it. 2. And in caſe of non-ſatisfaction, our Churches give them ſufficient ſatisfaction. 3. But if they will not be ſatisfied, when many thouſands are ſatisfied, we maintaine, that it is not equitable, that when 20000. or 30000. are ſatisfied, two, or three, under pretext of non-ſatiſfaction, or twenty, or thirty pertinacious fellowes ſhould have liberty to trouble all the Churches of God in the World. 4. We ſay moreover, that the Church, in diſputing and conferring with them, and afterward in judging that ſhe hath given them ſufficient ſatisfaction, hath given them ſufficient ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction morally; and that wiſe men ſhould judge it ſufficient, <hi>in foro Externo;</hi> and thereupon, that they are to be condemned by the Church <hi>in foro Externo;</hi> for there is no other way to proceed to ſentence, either <hi>in foro Civili,</hi> or <hi>Eccleſiaſtico.</hi> 5. If this will not ſatisfie them, yet if they will be quiet, and not trouble the Church of God with their Conventicles, we can in Chriſtian charity tolerate them in their weakneſſe, yea in their malice (if there be any) till God impart unto them more grace. But this ſerveth nothing for <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,</hi> who are come over the Sea to beg a quarrell of us, and to erect Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in deſpite of the Civill Magiſtrate, againſt all Lawes, yea againſt their own Tenets, if they write, as they believe; for they pretend, that Churches cannot be erected without the Civill Magiſtrates conſent. 6. If all this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent them not, and their Conſcience will not permit them to doe otherwiſe, the Ports are free for them, they may be gone, and live in all liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in <hi>New England,</hi> and trouble no more the Country here, then the Country ſhall trouble them there. 7. Or if this will not content them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will they have more liberty here, then they will grant us in <hi>New-England?</hi>

                     <hi>A.S.</hi> I diſtinguiſh the Conſequent of the Propoſition; <hi>They may judge by a publick Judgement:</hi> It is falſe; for every particular or private man hath not a publike power to <hi>judge,</hi> nor conſequently, a Publike judgement: they may judge by a private power, (which properly is not <gap reason="foreign">

And to end this Argument, I ask you, What if a man be oppreſſed in one of your Churches, (as it is poſſible a man may be, as well as in one of ours, unleſſe ye have <hi>the power of Piety,</hi> in a more Independent degree, yea, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all <hi>fleſh and blood in any juncture of time to come</hi>) and afterward he complains to Neighbour Churches, and they oppreſſe him by their Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; What other remedy can he have but patience, and to appeal to the Judge of quick and dead, or elſe acquieſce to the ſentence, or at leaſt ſuffer it? For a man cannot ſin in meer ſufferance; for actuall ſin materially is ever more an action of the will, or a voluntary omiſſion of ſome action.</p>

That, when I ſay the Civill Magiſtrate hath power <hi>in</hi> Religion, the word <hi>(in)</hi> ſignifies <hi>about;</hi> for Religion ſignifieth the object of the Civill Magiſtrate; and ſo we ſpeak or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily, as when we ſay, A rich mans heart is in his Money and Riches; ſo <hi>in</hi> here ſignifieth not an Intrinſecall, but an Extrinſecall Denomination; as when I ſay, The Sun is ſeen, the Attribute in this Affirmative Propoſition is
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:124638:32"/>ſaid to be in the Subject, not by any Intrinſecall Inherence, or Denomination, but by an Extrinſecall Adherence, Attribution, or Denomination: This little Childiſh Sophiſtication, is more worthy of ſome young ſmatterer in Logick then of a Divine, or any Conſcientious man: It is not poſſible, that <hi>M. S.</hi> could be ignorant of this; and therefore in this Diſpute, if he have any <hi>power of Piety,</hi> I deſire more Conſcience and Sincerity in him: I may alſo ſay, That the Civill Magiſtrate hath an Extrinſecall power in the Church, if the word <hi>(in)</hi> there ſignifie a bare Attribution, or Extrinſecall Denomination, as it is ordinary amongſt Divines, Philoſophers, and common people; and yet I confeſſe it is more properly ſaid <hi>about</hi> Religion, and <hi>about</hi> the Church, as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollonius</hi> obſerveth, and as I have expreſſed my ſelf; but then there ſhould have been a concurrence of <hi>in's,</hi> which would have made my Expreſſion ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure; for then I muſt have ſaid, The Civill Magiſtrate <hi>about</hi> matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, hath an Extrinſecall power, as alſo about the Church, as this Profeſſor of Eloquence would have me to ſpeak; which kinde of Expreſſion, I beleeve few or none could have underſtood.

                  <p>Some Eccleſiaſticall power is Extrinſecall to the Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A. S.</hi> I diſtinguiſh the word <hi>power</hi> of Citation; for it is either <hi>Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall,</hi> which is proper unto the Church, <hi>viz.</hi> In Church Officers gathered together in an <hi>Eccleſiaſticall Aſſembly;</hi> And this is both <hi>in,</hi> and <hi>about</hi> the Church or <hi>Civill,</hi> which is proper to the Chriſtian, and in ſome way to a non-Chriſtian Magiſtrate, where by his Civill power he maintaineth the Church; and this is out of the Church, in the Magiſtrate, and yet <hi>about</hi> the Church, which is its object: And ſo I anſwer to this ſilly Argument, That it is cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and grounded on an Equivocation; for it taketh the power of Citation in one ſignification in the Major, <hi>viz.</hi> For a Politicall power of Citation; and in an other in the Minor, <hi>viz.</hi> For an Eccleſiaſticall power of Citation. 2. Or if it be taken in both for an Eccleſiaſticall power, then the Major is falſe; for Chriſt gave it to the Church, to which it is Intrinſecall, and not to the Civill Magiſtrate. 3. Or if it be taken in both for a Civill power, then the Minor is falſe; for the Civill power of Citation is not in the <hi>Church,</hi> but in the Magiſtrate; neither ever gave <hi>Chriſt</hi> it (as <hi>Mediator</hi>) either to the <hi>Church,</hi> or to the Civill Magiſtrate; but God by Chriſt (as God) gave it onely to the Civill Magiſtrate: And the Peece, whereof the Preſſe, as <hi>M.

                     <hi>A. S.</hi> This Argument is ridiculous. 1. For it proveth not that which is in queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Civill Magiſtrate hath an <hi>Eccleſiaſticall</hi> or <hi>Intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecall power</hi> in the <hi>Church.</hi> 2. Onely it proveth, that the <hi>Church</hi> hath an <hi>Authority,</hi> that in ſome reſpect may be called <hi>Extrinſecall.</hi> 3. But to take away this Equivocation, and many others, and to explain more fully this queſtion, note again, 1. That the <hi>Church</hi> may be conſidered, either according to its <hi>Reall</hi> and <hi>Naturall,</hi> or according to its <hi>Morall</hi> being. 2. That the <hi>Church</hi> according to its <hi>Morall</hi> being (I ſpeak of the <hi>Repreſentative</hi>) is either <hi>Particular</hi> of one Pariſh or Congregation, or more <hi>Generall,</hi> as a <hi>Claſſicall</hi> or <hi>Synodall Aſſembly.</hi> 3. Note, that the <hi>particular Church,</hi> may be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red either <hi>Abſolutely,</hi> and in it ſelf alone, without any reference to a Claſſe or a Synod, whereof it is a part; or <hi>Relatively</hi> with a reference to the more <hi>Generall Church, viz.</hi> a <hi>Claſſis</hi> or <hi>Synod,</hi> whereof it is a part, or in quality, and under the notion of a part, in ſo far forth, as by ſome formall or virtuall Aſſent, it hath once Covenanted to be a part of ſuch a <hi>Claſſis</hi> or <hi>Synod,</hi> and Stipulated to ſend its <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> to ſuch Claſſicall or Synodall Meetings. 1. If then we conſider <hi>Citation</hi> or <hi>Excommunication</hi> with reference to the <hi>Church,</hi> either more <hi>Generall</hi> or <hi>Particular,</hi> according to its Naturall being, it may be Extrinſecall to them both; for the Act of <hi>Citation</hi> or <hi>Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> is not really produced or pronounced, according to its Naturall being, by the <hi>Church</hi> conſidered under the notion of its Reall being, but by one man, as all wiſe men will grant. 2. If they be taken morally according to their Morall being, grounded on ſome <hi>Covenant,</hi> then the Acts of <hi>Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>Citation</hi> are not Extrinſecall to the more <hi>Generall Church,</hi> ſince they are exerciſed by Her power and conſent. 3. If they be conſidered with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the <hi>Particular Church,</hi> then if the <hi>Particular Church</hi> be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Abſolutely, they may be Extrinſecall unto Her, ſince neither <hi>Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> nor <hi>Citation</hi> are exerciſed by Her Abſolutely, at leaſt Ordinarily. 4. If we conſider a <hi>Particular Church</hi> in reference to the more <hi>Generall Church, viz.</hi> under the notion of a part of the more <hi>Generall Church;</hi> then we may conſider Her either, 1. According to Her firſt <hi>Conſent</hi> and <hi>Covenant,</hi> Reall or Virtuall, whereby She joyned together in one <hi>Conſociation</hi> with many other <hi>Particular Churches,</hi> to make up together one <hi>Claſſe</hi> or <hi>Synod;</hi> the which <hi>Conſent</hi> preceded the Act of <hi>Citation</hi> or <hi>Excommunication;</hi> and whereby the <hi>Claſſe</hi> or <hi>Synod</hi> received Power to cite or excommunicate particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: Or 2. according to Her <hi>Conſent,</hi> in ſending Her <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> to the <hi>Claſſe</hi> or <hi>Synod:</hi> Or 3. according to Her ſubſequent or concomitant <hi>Diſſent</hi> to the Act of <hi>Excommunication</hi> or <hi>Citation.</hi> 4. If then She be conſidered
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:124638:33"/>according to Her firſt <hi>Covenant</hi> and <hi>conſent,</hi> or in the ſecond, <hi>i. e.</hi> in ſending Her <hi>Commiſſioners,</hi> the Act of <hi>Citation</hi> and <hi>Excommunication</hi> is voluntary, and Intrinſecall to that <hi>Particular Church,</hi> notwithſtanding Her ſubſequent or concomitant <hi>Diſſent;</hi> for that Act of <hi>Citation</hi> and <hi>Excommunication</hi> is done in vertue of ſuch precedent <hi>Conſents,</hi> which are Her <hi>Deeds,</hi> and very Legall. 5. If the <hi>Particular Church</hi> be conſidered according to Her ſubſequent or concomitant <hi>Diſſent,</hi> theſe Acts are involuntary, and Extrinſecall to that <hi>Particular Church:</hi> But ſuch a <hi>Diſſent</hi> is not properly and formally an Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall Act, ſince it is not ruled by any Eccleſiaſticall Rule of <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> but by private intereſt, or paſſion, which muſt ever give place to the Weal of the whole <hi>Church;</hi> for as Naturall bodies may be conſidered either Abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or under the notion of a Part, which is for the whole; and in the firſt notion, they have their Particular Inclinations and Motions, whereby they decline whatſoever is hurtfull unto them, as when the hand flyeth from a blow of a Sword; but under the ſecond, they are not led by their own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, but by the generall Inclination and Intereſt of the whole, ſince parts are not ſo much for themſelves, as for the whole; and ſo it neglecteth its own particular good or intereſt, for the weal or intereſt of the whole; as when the hand for fear leaſt the head ſhould be cut off, whereof might enſue the deſtruction of the whole man, expoſeth it ſelf to the danger in receiving the blow it ſelf, to ſave the whole: So in Politicall or Eccleſiaſticall Conſociations, particular Towns, or Churches, may be carried by their own Intereſts to ſome particular Diſſent in ſome Caſes; but if they move Regularly, ſometimes againſt their own Intereſts, they muſt Conſent againſt themſelves, according to the generall Inclination of the whole Conſociated body, or Church Claſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, Synodall, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 6. If this Argument hold, it will conclude, 1. Againſt that which is done by Plurality of Votes in their particular Congregations; For that which is concluded, is againſt the Conſent of the Minor part. 2. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that which is done in their Synods, by their Meſſengers, if they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude againſt, or without the Conſent of the Churches, whereof they are Meſſengers: And 3. Againſt the Parliament, if they conclude any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the particular Conſent of particular Towns; for they Conſent not thereunto; And ſo what they conclude or do againſt them ſhall not be done by Conſent of the Kingdom; And ſo this man ſhall deſtroy the Parliament, and the pretended Order of Independents, as well as that of Proteſtant Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>M. S.</hi> telleth us, that ſo the Claſſis is like to the Magiſtrate, who is a Biſhop without, and about the Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I deny your Simile; for the Magiſtrates Power and Act, being onely Politicall and Civill, has no Internall reference to <hi>Citation</hi> or <hi>Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,</hi> in quality of Eccleſiaſticall Acts, as that of the <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>Church Officers,</hi> which is Eccleſiaſticall; and this your Quinqu' Eccleſian

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Aſſumption is falſe, for I grant it to them all, but not in the ſame manner; To a Pagan only <hi>in actu ſignato,</hi> but to a true Chriſtian <hi>in actu exercito.</hi> I expound it in my Annotations upon the <hi>Apologeticall Narration.</hi>

It is alſo an error in you, to think, that <hi>in actu ſignato,</hi> and <hi>exercito,</hi> is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but <hi>actu &amp; potentia.</hi> 3. Put the caſe it be ſo, and that whatever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to any thing <hi>in actu ſignato,</hi> belongeth to it <hi>in actu exercito,</hi> what is that to the purpoſe? is not that enough to found a diſtinction upon? Wherever there is <hi>prius</hi> and <hi>poſterius,</hi> is there not there ſome <hi>diſtinction,</hi> at leaſt <hi>formall,</hi> or <hi>modall,</hi> if not <hi>reall?</hi> 4. Yea, put the caſe, the one part were really included in the other; yet ſhould there ever be <hi>diſtinctio includentis, &amp; incluſi.</hi> 5. And howſoever it be, that what belongeth to a perſon <hi>in actu exercito,</hi> belongeth to him <hi>in actu ſignato;</hi> yet what belongeth to a Thing <hi>in actu ſignato,</hi> belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not to it <hi>in actu exercito.</hi> Neither ſaid I, that whatever belongeth to any thing <hi>in actu exercito,</hi> belongeth not to it alſo <hi>in actu ſignato.</hi> Where ſaid I it, I pray you? or if I ſaid it not, wherefore beg you here a needleſſe quarrell with me about it?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>M.

Becauſe without the knowledge of our Religion, he can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther direct, nor act any thing about the Church, or for the Church, but by conjecture, or gueſſing at it. 4.

Now <hi>M.S.</hi> that affirmeth a thing to be, might more eaſily have found authorities for it in Scripture, (if any ſuch had been) then we, for things that are not: It is enough for me to ſay, that the Scripture, that conteineth all things needfull to ſalvation, conteineth no Extrinſecall power, <hi>in actu exercito,</hi> for Civill Magiſtrates, that are not Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</p>

Or if he hath it ſo, he hath it not to doe good to the Church, in quality of a Church; for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can he know, or love the Church, in quality of a Church, but of men, or members of the State: for the Church, in quality of a Church, is no wayes the object of his Knowledge, or Will. He may doe it, as an Aſſe, that carrieth the corne to the Mill; or as <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> who judged, that one man muſt dye for the People; but knew not what he ſaid. He cannot doe it by any power Intrinſecall to the Church, as <hi>M.S.</hi> pretends: And howbeit I ſhould grant unto a Iew, or a Pagan, a Civill power to doe good to the Church, both <hi>in actu ſignato,</hi> and <hi>exercito:</hi> yet from thence cannot be concluded an Intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecall or Eccleſiaſticall power belonging to a Iew, a Pagan, or to an Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian to rule the Church Internally.</p>

                     <hi>A.S.</hi> The Civill Magiſtrate, as a Chriſtian man, muſt learne Gods will, by all the meanes that God hath appointed him, viz. 1. By reading of Scriptures; 2. Comparing one Scripture with another; 3. Conferring in private about Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, &amp; of any difficulties he hath, with other Chriſtians, of whom he may learn any thing; 4. Hearing of Sermons; 5. As a Magiſtrate, he muſt have a Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call prudence, and knowledge of Scriptures to direct him in judging about Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, Hereſie, and matters of Religion; 6. He muſt ſerve himſelfe of prayer, and all the reſt of the meanes that God hath ordained him; 7. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſay we, that he muſt be directed by a Synod alone. This is one of the meanes that God hath ordained him in his Providence, but not all, as this <hi>M.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O the end we may the better, and more eaſily reſolve this Queſtion, it will not be amiſſe to note concerning the word Church. 1. That we mean not here the Triumphant Church in Heaven, but the Militant upon Earth. 2. That it is not meant touching the inviſible Church, <hi>viz.</hi> The Church of Beleevers, compounded of men and women, endowed with Juſtifying Faith, which is inviſible to us; but of the viſible Church, profeſſing the true Faith. 3. Nor of every viſible Church of Beleevers, but of that which is compounded of all its Organicall Parts, <hi>viz.</hi> Preachers, Teachers, Ruling Elders, Deacons, and Flock. 4. It is to be obſerved, That this Church is either Reall, or Repreſentative; We call Reall Churches, thoſe wherein ſuch Church Officers, and Flocks, are really, as in every Pariſh, Provinciall or Nation Church: But a Repreſentative Church is that, wherein the Reall Church is repreſented in Her Church Officers, as a Presbytery, Seſſion, or Conſiſtory, conſiſting of the Preachers and Ruling Elders, or the Deacons alſo of a Pariſh Church gathered together, for ordering of Church buſineſſe in Doctrine, Government, or otherwayes, who altogether repreſent the Church of a Pariſh: A Claſſe, that repreſenteth that of a Claſſe, and judgeth of all the <hi>Church</hi> buſineſſe of one <hi>Claſſe:</hi> A Provinciall Synod, which conſiſteth of the Miniſters, and a certain number of Ruling Elders of one Province, repreſenting all the Reall <hi>Churches</hi> of ſuch a Province, in judging of <hi>Church</hi> Affairs in that Province; and a Nationall Synod com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of a certain number of Miniſters and Ruling Elders, deputed from all the Provinces of the Nation, to judge of the <hi>Church</hi> buſineſſe in Doctrine, Diſcipline, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which concerneth the whole <hi>Church</hi> of ſuch a Nation or Kingdom.</p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:124638:36"/>
                  <p n="2">2. Concerning the Subordination of Eccleſiaſticall Judicatories, it is to be obſerved, 1. That an Eccleſiaſticall Judicatory is nothing elſe but a certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men, gathered together, and endowed with an Authoritative power, according to Gods will, to judge of <hi>Church</hi> buſineſſe, for Gods glory, and the Weal of the <hi>Church,</hi> or in a word, the Repreſentative <hi>Church</hi> of one Pariſh, Claſſe, Province, Nation, or of all the World. 2. That Subordination in Eccleſiaſticall Judicatories, is a Relation of Order, betwixt a Superiour, and an Inferiour Judicatory, or Repreſentative <hi>Church,</hi> whereby the Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Authority of the Inferiour, depends upon the Iudgement, and Authority of the Superiour: Such we conceive to be betwixt Presbyteries and Claſſes, Claſſes and Provinciall, Provinciall and Nationall, Nationall and Oecumenicall Synods.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Here it would be noted, That this Subordination is grounded upon the Authoritative power of Superiour Iudicatories, over their Inferiours, or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinated; and therefore here is to be noted, firſt, That this Power of the <hi>Church</hi> is not Naturall, that floweth from the Nature, or Eſſence of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, ſuch as are the Faculties of the Soul; nor Habituall, or an Habitude either Naturally acquired by <hi>Cuſtome,</hi> or Supernaturally infuſed by Grace; for men may have all the Naturall Faculties of the Soul, and many Naturall, and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall Habitudes; yea, all thoſe that are neceſſary for this Authoritative power, and yet not have it, as any one may eaſily ſee in many learned and godly Divines, who are not Miniſters of the <hi>Church,</hi> and conſequently have no Authoritative power in the <hi>Church:</hi> But it is a Morall power (ordinarily called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> or <hi>poteſtas</hi>) whereby in vertue of Gods Ordinance, the Superiour <hi>Church</hi> hath power over the Inferiours, or other <hi>Churches</hi> ſubordinated unto Her, to rectifie their Iudgements in caſe of Aberration, or to enjoyn them any thing according to Gods holy Ordinance. So when particular <hi>Churches</hi> judge any thing amiſſe either in Doctrine or Diſcipline, a <hi>Claſſe</hi> or a <hi>Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Synod</hi> may judge of that Iudgement, and in caſe it finde it have need, may in the Name of God, command it to reform its Iudgement; and in caſe of diſobedience, command the people not to obey their Paſtors or Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries commands; or if there be any thing, that concerneth the Weal of all the <hi>Churches</hi> in the Kingdom, the Nationall Synod hath an Authoritative power, to judge it, and enjoyn it upon the <hi>Churches</hi> in the Name of God; ſo may a <hi>Provinciall Church</hi> do in things concerning all the <hi>Churches</hi> of a Province. I call an Authoritative power, that which may command, and in vertue of its command, enjoyn an obligation of Obedience upon all thoſe that are ſubject thereunto; and in caſe of Diſobedience, inflict Spirituall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, according to the quality of the Diſobedience, <hi>viz.</hi> Simple Cenſure, the leſſer or greater Excommunication.</p>
                  <p>If ye inquire further, what is this Morall power, or wherein it conſiſts; I anſwer, It is no Reall, but a Morall being; it is no Reall quality in the Subject
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:124638:36"/>that hath it, and conſequently it is no Reall or Naturall power; but as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> were a Naturall power; for as our Naturall powers and faculties do flow from the Eſſence of the Subject, or from our Eſſentiall Forms; ſo doth this Morall power flow from the <hi>conſent</hi> and <hi>will</hi> of them who give it, and his <hi>will,</hi> who <hi>conſents</hi> to accept it; and this <hi>conſent</hi> producing ſuch a Morall power or <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>producens, quàm forma eſſentialis</hi> is <hi>forma informans potentiam naturalem a ſe, &amp; in ſe vel in ſubjecto profundens.</hi> And as naturall powers are for the Weal of their Subjects, in accompliſhing and perfecting of them in their operations, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to their nature; ſo its this Morall power for the Weal of its Morall Subject, or of the conſociation in perfecting it in its operations, convenient to its Morall being, Domeſticall, Politicall or Eccleſiaſticall, in Nature or in Grace. Wherefore <hi>Ameſius,</hi> and ſundry Independents, that follow his opinion, are mightily miſtaken, whileſt they think it floweth from the Eſſence of the <hi>Church.</hi> 1. For it hath not its being from the Eſſence of the <hi>Church,</hi> but <hi>ex inſtituto divino.</hi> 2. Becauſe it is not produced neceſſarily, as Naturall proprieties, but freely and willingly, not as depending upon Nature, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Will. 3. If it did flow from the Eſſence of the <hi>Church,</hi> God could not change it; And yet howſoever this Morall power hath no Reall being in it ſelf; yet may it be called Reall; 1. In conſideration of its Cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Of the Reall deſtination of the Will, from which its produced. 2. Of its Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe it preſuppoſeth ſome Reall qualities in him, or thoſe, who have it, <hi>viz.</hi> Naturall faculties, and ſome naturall or ſupernaturall Abilities to exerciſe it. 3. Of its Effects that are Reall; for howſoever the power of a Magiſtrate be not a Reall quality, yet it is able to produce very Reall Effects in Subjects, in remunerating ſuch as deſerve well of the State, and in puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Delinquents, as by impriſoning their perſons, or cutting off their Heads, if the crime be of that nature.</p>
                  <p>Again it muſt be obſerved, That this Morall power is, 1. either meerly <hi>Directive,</hi> which onely ſheweth what is to be done, or <hi>Imperative,</hi> that cannot onely ſhew, or diſcern what is to be done; but alſo commands, and in vertue of ſuch a command, bindes thoſe that are ſubject to ſuch a Power to Obedience, and in caſe of Diſobedience, inflicts condign puniſhments. 2. That this Morall power is either <hi>Civill</hi> or <hi>Eccleſiaſticall;</hi> the firſt belongs to the <hi>Civill Magiſtrate,</hi> the ſecond to <hi>Eccleſiaſticall perſons.</hi> 3. That Power is either <hi>Imperiall, Royall,</hi> or <hi>Magiſteriall,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Emperours, Kings,</hi> or <hi>Lords,</hi> have over their Subjects, as that of the <hi>Civill Magiſtrate;</hi> or <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſteriall,</hi> ſuch as <hi>State-Miniſters</hi> have under their Maſters, or Lords, as that of <hi>Ambaſſadors, Purſevants, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Finally it muſt be obſerved, That as Power, ſo puniſhments inflicted by Power, are either <hi>Civill</hi> or <hi>Eccleſiaſticall; Civill puniſhments</hi> are ſuch as are inflicted by the <hi>Civil Magiſtrate,</hi> and are often times corporall, as Mutilation,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:124638:37"/>Stigmatizing, and Death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſometimes Pecuniary mulcts, ſometimes In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy, <hi>&amp;c. Eccleſiaſticall puniſhments</hi> are altogether Spirituall, conſiſting of <hi>Cenſures, Suſpenſion</hi> from the <hi>Lords Table,</hi> and <hi>Excommunication.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe things being preſuppoſed, By the word <hi>Church</hi> here muſt be meant, the viſible <hi>Militant Church,</hi> and principally the <hi>Repreſentative Church,</hi> in <hi>Presbyteries, Claſſes, Synods.</hi> 2. By the word <hi>Subordination,</hi> muſt be meant a <hi>Subordination</hi> of <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Judgement.</hi> 3. By <hi>Power</hi> muſt be meant a <hi>Morall, Eccleſiaſticall, Imperative,</hi> and <hi>Miniſteriall Power</hi> in Iudging, Commanding, and Inflicting of Spirituall puniſhments onely, and not an <hi>Imperiall, Magiſteriall,</hi> or <hi>Royall Power,</hi> whereby the <hi>Church</hi> may command in a domineering way, or compell mens bodies, or puniſh them by inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Corporall puniſhment on them, or impoſing any Pecuniary mulcts; as the Independents moſt craftily go about to perſwade the World.</p>
                  <p>The Independents then deny, That there is any <hi>Church</hi> furniſhed with any <hi>Authoritative</hi> or <hi>Imperative Power,</hi> ſave onely the Pariſhionall, or to ſpeak in their own Terms, the <hi>Congregationall Church.</hi> And therefore they renounce all <hi>Claſſicall</hi> and <hi>Synodicall Churches;</hi> or if they do acknowledge them, they allow them no <hi>Authoritative</hi> or <hi>Imperative,</hi> but a <hi>Conſultative Power</hi> onely, or a Power to counſell one of their little <hi>Congregations</hi> (compounded happily of ſeven or eight perſons) what they think fitteſt to be done; ſo that this <hi>petty Congregation</hi> may either accept or reject their Counſell, at their own likings and pleaſure: ſo as in concluſion, they acknowledge no <hi>Authoritative,</hi> or <hi>Imperative Eccleſiaſticall power,</hi> above that of their <hi>little Congregations;</hi> for they maintain, that every <hi>Church,</hi> be it never ſo ſmall, yea, though it be compoſed but of ſeven or eight perſons (be it never ſo Erroneous and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall) is altogether Independent in its Iudgement, upon all the Iudgements of all the <hi>Churches</hi> of the World, be they never ſo Iuſt and Orthodox; and conſequently, that what ever they teach, how Heretically ſoever; and what ever they do, be it never ſo wicked, that all the <hi>Orthodox Churches</hi> in the World, have no Authority of God to Cenſure, or to Excommunicate, or ſo much, as to command them, other wayes then any one private man might do an other, <hi>i. e.</hi> By way of Counſell, which they may either follow or reject at their pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Orthodox</hi> and <hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> eſpecially of <hi>Scotland, France,</hi> the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> &amp;c. on the other part hold, That there is and ought to be <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination</hi> amongſt <hi>Eccleſiaſticall Judicatories, viz.</hi> That <hi>Nationall Synods</hi> are above <hi>Provinciall Synods;</hi> theſe above <hi>Claſſes,</hi> and <hi>Claſſes</hi> above <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries</hi> or <hi>Seſſions;</hi> and that the <hi>Superiour Judicatories</hi> have a <hi>Miniſteriall Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative</hi> or <hi>Imperative,</hi> but no <hi>Magiſteriall, Deſpoticall,</hi> or <hi>Imperiall, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative power</hi> over the <hi>Inferiour,</hi> that are ſubordinate unto them. <hi>Item,</hi> That they may inflict upon <hi>Inferiour Churches,</hi> in caſe of Diſobedience, <hi>Spirituall,</hi> though no <hi>Corporall puniſhments,</hi> or <hi>Pecuniary mulcts,</hi> or ſuch like <hi>Civil puniſhments.</hi>

                  <p>Theſe three laſt Propoſitions contradict not the reſt; For in the 4. Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, p. 48. of my Book, I ſpeak not of the ground of Eccleſiaſticall Diſcipline, nor of it all; only I ſay, that it is not in Church-Miniſters power to transferre the Eccleſiaſticall power unto the Civill Magiſtrate: Which contradicteth not the firſt three.</p>
                  <p>In the 5. <hi>Only Gods Word, &amp;c.</hi> But, 1. Gods Word, there, muſt not be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſtrictly, for that which is Gods Word <hi>formally, in terminis, &amp; Theticè;</hi> but in a more large ſignification, 1. For Gods Word, <hi>formally,</hi> or by <hi>conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence:</hi> 2. <hi>In terminis, aut in ſenſu:</hi> 3. <hi>Theticè, aut Hypotheticè,</hi> by ſome <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,</hi> or <hi>Suppoſition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. If ye take <hi>Gods Word</hi> in the laſt ſenſe, then <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> or <hi>Government</hi> muſt be taken for <hi>Diſcipline</hi> in its eſſentiall and principall integrant parts, and not in all its accidentall and circumſtantiall parts: Neither is it needfull, that we have any particular rules from Scripture, for every circumſtance of Doctrine or Diſcipline: As for example, That Sermons ſhould be on ſuch or ſuch Week-dayes; ſo long, viz. an houre, or two houres long; in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or afternoon; That Eccleſiaſticall Senates ſhould ſit once a day, once a week, or once a moneth.</p>
                  <p>In the 6. Propoſition, 1. <hi>Diſcipline</hi> there, muſt be taken for Diſcipline <hi>quoad Eſſentialia, Subſtantialia, &amp; Neceſſaria;</hi> and not <hi>quoad Accidentalia, Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantialia, Contigentia, &amp; Indifferentia;</hi> as appeareth by my words in the laſt part thereof, <hi>New Eccleſiaſticall Lawes in things indifferent, &amp;c.</hi> 2. <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> muſt be taken in a large ſignification, as I have already declared: for ſo only is it taken by our Doctors, when we prove againſt the Papiſts, that it is the only Rule of Faith.</p>
                  <p>In the 2. Poſition, when I ſay, <hi>Subordination needeth not, &amp;c.</hi> the word <hi>needeth</hi> muſt not be taken for <hi>neceſſarium abſolutè,</hi> or <hi>quoad eſſe;</hi> but, <hi>ſecundum quid, &amp; ad bene eſſe;</hi> not to its being, but to its well-being: for howbeit <hi>Chriſt</hi> had not given us any patent of <hi>Subordination in Eccleſiaſticall Judicatories,</hi> in the Goſpel; yet the Law of Nature, and the Scripture of the Old Teſtament had been ſufficient to direct us therein, and had bound the Church of the New Teſtament to the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Government: And this, <hi>M. S.</hi> acknowledgeth himſelfe, (howbeit not without ſome Comedian jeeres, more ordinary with him then any apparent Reaſon) and confeſſeth, that the words following in the 3. Propoſition, declare it.</p>
                  <p>But put the caſe, that <hi>Presbyterians</hi> differed (as he ſaith) whether it be <hi>juris Divini, Naturalis, aut Humani:</hi> as they differ not, for any thing I know, or have read: Yet they agree in this, That it is <hi>Juris.</hi> Confeſſe this, and ye may
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:124638:39"/>live in a Fraternall communion with us, for the Difference, viz. If one ſay, it is <hi>juris Divini;</hi> another, <hi>Naturalis;</hi> another, <hi>Eccleſiaſtici;</hi> will not breed a Schiſme; for it is not a Diſpute <hi>de re, ſed de modo rei,</hi> to know whether it proceedeth from God, as Author of the Law of Nature, or of Grace, by a Naturall, or a Poſitive Law: Much leſſe materiall is it to know, whether it be in Scripture <hi>explicitè,</hi> or <hi>implicitè; formaliter, aut per conſequentiam; in terminis, aut in ſenſu, et conſequenter; Theticè,</hi> or <hi>Hypotheticè.</hi>

                     <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Containing the Arguments, whereby we prove the Opinion of the Orthodoxe Churches, againſt the <hi>Independents,</hi> borrowed from the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</head>
                  <p>THe Arguments, that might be brought for the Orthodox <hi>Churches</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all Sectaries, are many, whereof I will touch a few, ſome from Scriptures of the Old and New Teſtament, and others from reaſon, founded on Scripture; but to proceed more cleerly, I intend to prove, 1. That in Scripture there is more, then a Congregationall, Independent <hi>Church;</hi> 2. a Subordination of <hi>Churches,</hi> and that in Authority.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Whether in Scripture, or in Reaſon, we find more then a Congregationall Church?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We affirme, and prove it thus, 1. Such a <hi>Church,</hi> and Church-government, as was amongſt the people of God in the Old Teſtament, and is not abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the New, may be admitted amongſt his people in the New.</p>
                  <p>But a <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>Church</hi> Government, more then Congregationall, and Independent, was amongſt the people of God, in the Old Teſtament, and is not abrogated in the New Teſtament. <hi>Ergo,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Church</hi> Government, more then Congregationall and Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent, may be admitted amongſt his people in the New Teſtament.</p>
                  <p>As for the firſt Propoſition, I beleeve our Adverſaries will not deny it, for if it was in the Old Teſtament, it was either by Gods Ordinance, or by his Approbation; If God ordained it, how can they aboliſh it? If he approved it, how can they reprove it?</p>
                  <p>And for the Aſſumption, I prove it; 1. For they had a Nationall <hi>Church; God dealt not ſo vvith every Nation,</hi> Pſal. 147.19, 20. Deut. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.13, 14, 20.23.33, 34.37. Deut. 7.6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Deut. 10.12.15.21. Deut. 26.17, 18, 19. Deut. 28.9, 10. Deut. 29.13, 14, 15. And Deut. 32. verſ. 8, 9. &amp;c. <hi>When the moſt High divided to the Nations their Inheritance, when he ſeperated the ſons of</hi> Adam; Iacob was the Lot of his Inheritance, &amp;c. Amos 3.2. <hi>You onely have I known of all the Families of the Earth.</hi> Deut. 39.29. <hi>Happy art thou, O Iſrael, who is like unto thee, O People? ſaved by the Lord, the ſhield of thy help, and who is the ſword of thy Encellency.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:124638:39"/>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe Independents define a Congregationall <hi>Church,</hi> a number of men, Covenanted together, to participate of Gods Ordinances, viz. the hearing of the <hi>Word,</hi> the receiving of the <hi>Sacraments &amp;c.</hi> in ſome one place, every Sabbath day.</p>
                  <p>But all the <hi>Church</hi> of the <hi>Jewes</hi> could not meet in one place, in ſuch a faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as every man will eaſily grant. <hi>Ergo,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Becauſe the great Sanedrim at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> judged of all Eccleſiaſticall Cauſes throughout all the Kingdome.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Becauſe the People of God, beſides their Aſſemblyes in the Temple (which was an holy place, common to all their Nationall <hi>Church</hi>) had their particular Conventions, in particular Synagogues.</p>
                  <p>And however men may doubt of theſe Synagogues, whether they were <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſtituto divino,</hi> or not, and of the <hi>time,</hi> when firſt they began; yet can it not be denied, but if they were not <hi>divinae inſtitutionis,</hi> they were, at leaſt, <hi>divinae approbationis.</hi> 1. For they are no where condemned in Scripture. 2. But Chriſt and his Apoſtles approved them, in that they went ordinarily to them, diſputed and expounded Scripture in them. 3. And ſubmitted themſelves unto the order and Diſcipline eſtabliſhed therein.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> But the Independents will ſay, that the Nationall <hi>Church</hi> is abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated in the New Teſtament.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Iuſt.</hi> 1. Then it is their part, to point us to the place in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where it is abrogated.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It cannot be abrogated in the New Teſtament; for thoſe Ordinances only of the Old Teſtament are abrogated in the New, that belonged unto the Ceremoniall Law: But to have a <hi>Church,</hi> or a <hi>Church</hi> Government, more then Congregationall, <hi>per ſe,</hi> or conſidered in it ſelfe, belong not to the <hi>Ceremoniall</hi> Law. <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Major is certaine, I prove the Minor. 1. For it might have been even in the State of Integrity, without the <hi>Ceremoniall</hi> Law. 2. And ſo indeed it was after the Fall, before ever <hi>Moſes</hi> his <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall</hi> Law was made. 3. And that is not meerely <hi>Ceremoniall,</hi> whereof we may evidently give naturall reaſon, or that which is evidently grounded in naturall reaſon, or at leaſt in ſo far as evidently grounded in naturall reaſon, ſince it is meerely Poſitive. But (ſuppoſing that there is a <hi>Church</hi> of God) to have, a <hi>Church,</hi> or a <hi>Church</hi> Government, more then Congregationall and Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent, is evidently grounded in naturall reaſon, or a thing where evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently we may give Naturall reaſon, &amp;c. as wee ſhall ſee here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. <hi>Ergo,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Only thoſe things of the Old Teſtament, are abrogated by the New, which were ſhadows of things to come, viz. of Chriſt Reall, or Miſtycall; But ſuch a <hi>Church,</hi> i. e. more then a Congregationall, Independent <hi>Church,</hi> was not a ſhadow of things to come in Chriſt, &amp;c. <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Major is certaine,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:124638:40"/>for the things commanded, or approved in the Old Teſtament, belonged, either to the Morall or to the Ceremoniall, or to the Judiciall Law: As for the things of the firſt ſort, they are <hi>juris naturalis,</hi> and conſequently perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, which are not abrogated, and of themſelves were not ſhadows of things to come: As for thoſe of the Judiciall Law, of themſelves they are not ſhadows, but belong unto Civill Government, which Chriſt abrogated not, ſince his Kingdom was not of this world; and if the Jews had ſubmitted themſelves to Chriſt, and had been freed from externall oppreſſion, it is probable, that they ſhould have enjoyed their own Government, according to the Judiciall Law, ſo far forth as Judiciall; neither was it his aym to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw any worldly States, Policies, or Politicall Laws: Chriſts Kingdom was, and is compatible with all the Kingdoms and States of the world, if they will not deſtroy it; and he will let them reign over mens bodies and purſes, if they can let him reign over their Souls. Theſe, that were commanded in the Ceremoniall Law, were indeed ſhadows; but ſuch was not a Church more then Congregationall.</p>
                  <p>To all theſe Reaſons ſome have anſwered, That they would have it proved by Scriptures of the New Teſtament, juſt: 1. But wherefore prove they their opinion by the Old Teſtament, if they will not permit us the ſame liberty? 2. Our former Reaſons have ſufficiently proved, That proofs taken from the Old Teſtament, ſhould hold in all that, which is not abrogated in the New. 3. If in this Subject they reject the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament, as the Jews in all things that of the New, there will be two Errors Diametrically oppoſite, the one to the other, theirs, and the Jews.</p>
                  <p>But to give them more contentment, we will prove it likewiſe by Texts of the New Teſtament; and firſt, from that of the <hi>Acts,</hi> Chapters 1, 2, 4, and 5.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A Church compounded of 8120. is more then a Pariſhionall, or Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gationall Independent Church.</p>
                  <p>But the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem, Acts</hi> 1.15. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41. <hi>Acts</hi> 4.4. was a Church, compounded of 8120. yea, of more, as appeareth by <hi>Acts</hi> 5.14, 26. <hi>Ergo,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was more, ſure then a Pariſhionall, or Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gationall Independent Church.</p>
                  <p>The Major Propoſition is certain; for the Independents define their Church, which Chriſt in his Goſpel hath inſtituted, and to which he hath committed the Keyes of his Kingdom, the Power of binding and looſing, the Tables and Seales of the Covenant, the Officers and Cenſures of his Church, the Adminiſtration of his publike Worſhip and Ordinances. <hi>Caetus,</hi> a company of Beleevers, meeting in one place every Lords day, for the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Holy Ordinances of God, to publike Edification. <hi>[The
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:124638:40"/>Way of the Church of Chriſt in New England] The due Right of Presbyteries, Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>Prop.</hi> 1.] From hence I argue thus:</p>
                  <p>The Church, whereunto cannot be applyed this Definition, becauſe of its multitude, is more then an Independent Congregationall Church.</p>
                  <p>But a Church compounded of 8120, is a Church, whereunto cannot be applyed this Definition, <hi>&amp;c. Ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Major is certain: The Minor I prove it; for 8120. could not meet together every Lords day in one Houſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For in thoſe times Chriſtians had not yet any Temples, but gathered together in particular Houſes, which could not receive them all, 1. Becauſe they were not ordinarily ſpacious, as great and rich mens Houſes; for as the Apoſtle ſayeth, There <hi>are not many wiſe men after the fleſh, nor many mighty, nor many noble called, but the fooliſh, weak, baſe, and deſpiſed things of the world,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.26, 27, 28. 2. Howbeit they had been ſpacious, as rich mens houſes, yet could they not have received ſuch a number. 3. Howbeit they could have received ſuch a number, yet could not ſuch a number have all heard a Miniſter Preaching; yea, though he had the voice of a <hi>Stentor,</hi> ſuch, as were not all the Apoſtles; for St. <hi>Paul</hi> had his voice very weak, <hi>His Letters</hi> (ſay they, <hi>i. e.</hi> his Adverſaries) <hi>are weighty and powerfull, but his bodily preſence is weak, and his ſpeech contemptible,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.10. 5. Howbeit, they could have all met together, to hear the Word, yet could they not meet together, to participate of the Lords Holy Table; for in thoſe times, the Cuſtome was to Communicate at Table ſitting, according to the Cuſtome of other Orientall people, in circle, every one having his hand upon his fellows breaſt, and their feet without, which 8120. could not ſo conveniently do in one room. 6. Put the caſe they could have all heard the Word, and Communicated at the Lords Table together, yet could they not ſo conveniently have voted in Eccleſiaſticall Senates, or Iudica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, as they pretend every Member of the Church hath power to do, and as they do actually in caſe of Appeal from the Presbytery, unto the people. For I put the caſe, that thoſe 8120. ſhould have gathered together, to judge in ſome matter of Doctrine, or Cenſure, and that every one of the people ſhould have employed one fourth part of an hour in delivering of his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (whereas, Ile warrant you, ſome of them might employ a whole day, and at night ſay little to purpoſe) this voting would take up 20. or 30. hours: Put the caſe again, they ſhould ſit four hours every day (which hardly every Trades-man can ſpare) it ſhould amount to 507. dayes, which is almoſt two yeers, omitting the Lords dayes; ſo in gathering their votes once onely, there would be ſpent nigh upon two yeers: But what if there ſhould fall in many (put the caſe ten or twelve) incidents, and that ſome of this Reverend Synod would protract the buſineſſe, as ſome do here, to ſpin out time, as we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand? When ſhould theſe buſineſſes be decided?</p>
                  <p>Again, What if ſome of the people, peradventure ſome conſiderable
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:124638:41"/>number ſhould be abſent (for appearingly they could not ever all be preſent) could any judgement given in their abſence, binde them to condeſcend unto it? If it could, it ſhould be but a very blinde obedience; if not, there muſt of neceſſity be matter of Schiſme, which <hi>per ſe</hi> would ordinarily fall out in ſuch a Conſtitution of an Independent Church. Many things will happily here be replied about divers compendious wayes of gathering of ſuffrages, as in divers Senates, as amongſt the Romans, Athenians, the Parliaments in <hi>France,</hi> in <hi>Venice, &amp;c.</hi> but to no purpoſe, for this extravagant faſhion of voting of ſo great multitudes, wherein every one pretends a liberty, or licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſſe rather, in prophecying, whereunto ſuch wayes of gathering of ſuffrages can no wayes be applyed.</p>
                  <p>Some will anſwer, 1. That this Church, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. was an extraordinary Church, compounded of Apoſtles, who were extraordinary Miniſters.</p>
                  <p>Inſt. The Text ſayeth not, that it was extraordinary or compounded of Apoſtles alone. 2. The Apoſtles were onely twelve, but this Church was of ten times twelve, <hi>i. e.</hi> of one hundred and twenty, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.15. and eight thouſand more. 3. The twelve Apoſtles could not make it extraordinary in number, in ſuch a manner as that they could not meet together in one place; for they were but twelve, who might have been received in as ſmall rooms, as other men.</p>
                  <p>Some will anſwer, 2. It may be ſaid, That the Church, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. was but of one hundred and twenty perſons.</p>
                  <p>Inſt. I reply. But that of one hundred and twenty perſons, and that of 8120. perſons, was all one formally; and they differed onely in their matter, as an Infant, and a Man of fourty yeers. 2. That it ſufficeth, that a Church, according to Gods Ordinance, may be compounded of ſo many perſons, as are incompatible with the Conſtitution of an Independent Church. 3. And howbeit it be not <hi>Acts</hi> 1. yet Scripture, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. and 4. is no leſſe Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, then <hi>Acts</hi> 1.4. and yet that paſſage <hi>Acts</hi> 1. doth the buſineſſe; for that Church provided a Miniſter for all the Churches of the World, which is more, then any Independent or Congregationall Church can do. And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever calls this Aſſembly, or the Acts thereof, extraordinary; yet may not the Independents do ſo, ſince that from this place, ſome of them, as <hi>Robinſon, Inſti. p.</hi> 168, 169. proves an ordinary power in the Church to ordain, and depoſe Her Officers; the which proof ſhould be very ridiculous and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, if from an extraordinary Church, or an extraordinary Act, they ſhould infer an ordinary Church, or an ordinary Act of an ordinary Church; It ſhould be all one, as if they ſhould prove, That Independents have power to raiſe the dead, becauſe the Apoſtles had ſuch a power.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Arg. Act.</hi> 5. After that viſible judgement of God, that befell <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira, verſ.</hi> 5, 10. Beleevers were the more added unto the Lord, multitudes both men and women, <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. The number of the Diſciples were
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:124638:41"/>much more multiplied, cap. 6. v. 1. in Hieruſalem <hi>greatly,</hi> and a great company of the Prieſts were obedient to the Faith, ver. 7. who could not all meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is certaine. 1.

                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 6. The <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Antioch</hi> is one, and yet it is probable, that there were many <hi>Congregationall Churches</hi> there; for <hi>many of the Jewes and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Proſelytes</hi> at Antioch <hi>followed Paul and Barnabas,</hi> Act. 13. v. 43. <hi>And the next Sabbath day, came almoſt the whole City together, to heare the Word of God,</hi> v. 44.

So <hi>there were certaine Prophets,</hi> and <hi>Teachers,</hi> as <hi>Barnabas, Simeon, Lucius, Manahem,</hi> Act. 13. v. 1. and ſundry others, which had <hi>come down from Iudea,</hi> Act. 15. v. 1.

There <hi>Paul reaſoned in the Synagogue every Sabbath day, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded the Jewes and the Greeks,</hi> Act. 18.4. <hi>And Criſpus the chiefe Ruler of the Synagogue beleeved on the Lord with all his houſe; and many of the Corinthians hearing, beleeved, and were baptized, v.</hi> 8. <hi>And the Lord ſpake by viſion to Paul, ſaying, I have much people in this City,</hi> v. 10. <hi>Paul continued there a yeere and ſix moneths,</hi> v. 11. God promiſed him, <hi>that no man ſhould ſet on him to hurt him,</hi> v. 10. <hi>The Iewes, that had made an inſurrection againſt him,</hi> v. 12. were drawn from the <hi>Iudgement ſeat</hi> by <hi>Gallio</hi> the Pro-Conſul or Deputy of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaia,</hi> v. 18. <hi>Soſthenes,</hi> the <hi>chiefe Ruler of the Synagogue,</hi> beaten away by the Greeks, v. 17. This <hi>Gallio</hi> was not <hi>Pauls,</hi> or the Chriſtians enemy, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by all his proceedings, v. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. where it is to be obſerved, that <hi>Corinth</hi> was the Metropolis of <hi>Achaia,</hi> ſo potent and opulent, that it might have diſputed the Empire of the World with any other, which the Romans reckoned only three in the World fit to do, viz. <hi>Carthage, Corinth,</hi> and <hi>Capua.</hi> Now ſince the City was ſo great, ſo rich, ſo populous, and <hi>S. Paul</hi> by ſo ſpeciall a manner of Divine providence and promiſe aſſiſted there, ſo as that <hi>Criſpus</hi> the chiefe Ruler of the Synagogue was converted, <hi>Gallio</hi>
                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:124638:42"/>the Proconſul became <hi>Pauls</hi> friend, and peradventure not far from the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven; <hi>S.

Out of all doubt, more then could conveniently meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one houſe, to participate of all Chriſts Ordinances: And it was not <hi>Pauls</hi> cuſtome to ſtay long in any place, where the Goſpel was much contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted, or proſpered not, as we may collect from the 6. verſe of this chapter, and from chap. 19. v. 9.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 8. We may prove as much from the 19. chapter, concerning the City of <hi>Epheſus:</hi> where I pray the Reader to conſider, how <hi>Epheſus</hi> was a very potent, rich, and populous City of <hi>Aſia minor,</hi> of great Trading in regard of its ſituation betwixt the South and Weſt, it being the way to ſaile from <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Egypt</hi> into <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Macedonia.</hi> For all theſe reaſons it was very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, as alſo for the Temple of <hi>Diana,</hi> its Idolatry, and many curious Arts there profeſſed, as Naturall, and Diabolicall Magick; the profeſſion whereof, ſome Independents, as it is related by <hi>M. S.</hi> uſe, it ſhould ſeeme, now and then, to conſult about men of Letters, and their Books, in theſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitous times of Reformation. About that time that <hi>S. Paul</hi> taught there, there was one <hi>Apollonius Thyanaeus,</hi> who, as it is related of him, erected a Schoole of Magick there, who by the voice of Birds knew their very imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and deſires, &amp;c. This man was <hi>Chriſts,</hi> and <hi>S. Pauls</hi> enemy, as it is related of him. We have alſo an Adage in <hi>Eraſmus, Epheſiae literae,</hi> which were ſome Magick <hi>characters,</hi> and <hi>words,</hi> which made ſuch as caried them, victorious in all they undertook: See more about them in that Adage, in the Title <hi>Impoſturae.</hi> Without doubt, <hi>Paul</hi> converted here more then could meet in one Congregation; and yet it is called a <hi>Church.</hi> 1. At his firſt entry, by the impoſition of his hands, he gave the Holy Ghoſt unto 12 Diſciples, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it was given them by Jeſus Chriſt, upon the impoſition of his hands, ſo that <hi>they ſpake with Tongues, and propheſied,</hi> v. 6. and ſo there was now a good number of good Inſtruments. 2. He <hi>diſputed boldly in the Synagogue</hi> for the ſpace of <hi>three moneths, perſwading the things concerning the Kingdome of God,</hi> v. 8. which he could not have done, unleſſe he had had many good friends there. 3. Afterwards, <hi>daily in the Schoole of one Tyrannus,</hi> for the ſpace of <hi>two yeeres,</hi> v. 9.10. which without doubt he had not continued to doe ſo long, if the Goſpel had not had great fruits there; for ſo ſoon as ſome ſpake evill of it, in the Synagogue, the Text ſayes, <hi>He ſeparated his Diſciples</hi> from it. I know, that there is ſome diſpute about theſe words, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>in Schola Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranni cujuſdam,</hi> v. 9. ſome thinking, that <hi>Tyrannus</hi> is a proper name, others, that it is a common name, ſignifying ſome great-man, of great credit and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, as ſome great Lord, perchance: and <hi>Schola</hi> may ſignifie a Schoole, is a Hall, or place of recreation, ſuch as Noblemen uſe to have: But however
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:124638:43"/>it be taken, this Text proveth plainly, that <hi>S. Paul</hi> had great credit, was in a high eſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eme, and that the Goſpel had a great progreſſe, and a happy ſucceſſe. 4. But let this <hi>Tyrannus</hi> be the proper name of ſome Maſter, or Profeſſor in a Colledge, as <hi>Tyrannus Sophiſta,</hi> as <hi>Baronius</hi> would have him to be, <hi>tom.</hi> 1. <hi>Annal.</hi> or any other; it is a ſigne, whatever he was, that he was not contrary, but became a great friend to the Goſpel, ſince he permitted <hi>S. Paul</hi> to teach ſo long in his Colledge, during which time, it is probable, he might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted himſelfe. 5. If it be a common name, or ſignifies any great Lord, and that <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> ſignifie ſome great Hall, <hi>Porticum,</hi> or ſpacious place, as ſome will have it to doe; it is a ſigne, that he had great credit, and acceſſe to great men, ſince he had ſuch an Houſe at command to make a Schoole of, and that for ſo long time together, as the ſpace of <hi>two yeeres:</hi> Without all doubt, a Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that would endure this trouble for the Goſpel, was not far from Chriſt, if he was not a Chriſtian altogether; for Noblemen willingly never favour pretended Novelties, ſuch as the Goſpel was amongſt the Epheſians. 6. And if <hi>S. Paul</hi> made choice of ſuch a place, to the end he might be protected by the Lord of it, as many of the Expoſitors of this place are of opinion; without all doubt, there were a great party there Chriſtians; for Noblemen willingly will not hazard their eſtates for Religion, nor ſuffer publike exerciſe of a new Religion in their houſes, nor protect Novelties of ſo great conſequence, if they ſee any danger, or feare a ſtronger party: and therefore in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, the Chriſtians were very ſtrong there, ſince they had ſuch publick exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of their Religion, and ſo many friends, and thoſe of the greateſt. 7. This may be confirmed further, by the great apprehenſion that <hi>Demetrius,</hi> and all the Silver-Smiths had conceived of their utter undoing, by reaſon of the notable progreſſe of the Goſpel; and by the tumult that he made, which, it is like, he would not have done, unleſſe he had mightily apprehended the party of the Chriſtians, and the undoing of <hi>Diana,</hi> and her Temple; And by his diſcourſe, viz. that <hi>Paul</hi> had perſwaded much people, not in <hi>Epheſus</hi> alone, but almoſt throughout all <hi>Aſia.</hi> 8. Becauſe, howbeit in this tumult the people had laid hold on <hi>Gaius</hi> and <hi>Ariſtarchus, Pauls</hi> companions, and ruſhed into the Theatre; yet did they them no harme, for feare, in all likelihood, of the Chriſtians party; for <hi>feare fell on them all,</hi> v. 12.9. And all this may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, for that <hi>Paul</hi> had many of the greateſt of <hi>Aſia</hi> for his friends, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth from the 31. verſe, who hindred him to enter into the tumult, for feare he ſhould receive any hurt: And the Great men, doubtleſſe, drew many of meaner condition after them. 10. Becauſe <hi>S. Paul</hi> wrought great miracles amongſt them, to the terror of ſome, to the admiration of others, and to the great contentment and profit of others: To the terror of ſome, as appeareth by the accidents that befell ſome <hi>Exoreiſts</hi> of the Iewes, the ſonnes of <hi>Sceva,</hi> chiefe of the Prieſts; after the which, the Text ſaith, <hi>fearefell upon them,</hi> v. 17. To the admiration of others, becauſe <hi>miracles,</hi> they are admirable, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:124638:43"/>thoſe that are unimitable by others: To the contentment and profit of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, becauſe that the handkerchiefes or aprons caried from <hi>S. Pauls</hi> body, <hi>cured their diſeaſes,</hi> and <hi>chaſed a way the evill ſpirits out of them,</hi> v. 12. the which could not but draw very many Diſciples unto him. 11. Becauſe all theſe things were known to all the Iewes and Greeks of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> which could not be, without at leaſt a toleration, and ſome approbation of thoſe that were in authority: and ſo the Party was great and ſtrong. 12. Becauſe this being <hi>known to them all, the name of the Lord Ieſus was magnified,</hi> v. 17.13. Becauſe <hi>many that beleeved, came and confeſſed their deeds,</hi> v. 18. So then many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved. 14. Becauſe <hi>many of them alſo, which uſed curious Arts, burned their Books, amounting to the ſum of</hi> 15000. <hi>pieces of ſilver,</hi> v. 19. yet it is not ſaid, that they all, but that many of them burned their Books; ſo that beſides thoſe Magicians who burned their Books, there muſt have been many other Magici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans converted; And yet thoſe Books being of ſo great a value, could not but belong to many; and indeed the Text calleth them many. Now in a great City, ordinarily, are but a ſmall number that give their minds to Letters, but far leſſe, that give their minds to Sciences, and yet fewer, that apply their minds to curious Arts and Sciences; and yet here they were many. Note yet, that theſe curious Arts could not be Naturall Magick, nor Iudiciall Aſtrologie, Phyſiognomy, &amp;c. for theſe Arts being lawfully uſed, are lawfull, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it had been no need to burne the Books which treated of them, it had been much better to ſell them for the neceſſities of diſtreſſed Chriſtians; <hi>ergo,</hi> they muſt have been ſome Diabolicall Arts, ſuch as <hi>Apollonius Thyanaus</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, whereunto belonged thoſe <hi>Literae Epheſiae</hi> alſo. Now of all thoſe, who are given to curious Arts, very few are given to Diabolicall Arts againſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: fince then there were ſo many of ſuch Diabolicall Scholars, whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, above all other men, is the hardeſt; how many might there have been of other men of Letters converted? but how many more of the People? It is probable, that <hi>Tyrannus</hi> Schoole was a Schoole of Magick, and perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, <hi>Apollonius Thyanaus</hi> was his <hi>Second</hi> or <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher,</hi> and had the title of <hi>Profeſſor,</hi> in his abſence; and, that <hi>the Word of God grew ſo mightily, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed,</hi> as the Text ſaith, v. 20. by the meanes of <hi>S. Pauls</hi> Mieacles, whereby the Devill, and all his Magicians were ſo mightily affronted; and that thoſe Magicians being ſo affronted and converted, many others were converted by their example. 15. It is to be noted, that all theſe things, viz. Miracles, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of ſo many to the Goſpel amongſt them, their Profeſſion thereof, and the burning of thoſe Bookes, were done publikely, which appearingly they would not have done, if they had not had a ſtrong Party, and had been a very great number; Durſt a few men, or many inconſiderable men ſo publikely have renounced the Religion of their Country, and their Great <hi>Diana</hi> of <hi>Eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus,</hi> if they had not been backed with force enough? For howſoever per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance ſome zealous men might have done ſo, yet is it ſearce credible, that
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:124638:44"/>many would have done it; for of thoſe, who receive Chriſt, many, yet the beſt men are ſundry times tempted with feare, as we ſee in St. <hi>Peter</hi> his denying his Maſter, and in all the Apoſtles in flying away; neither is it ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more needfull, that we make ſo open profeſſion of Chriſt, when we may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearingly ſuffer for him; for the ſheep may fly away from the Wolfe, as the woman fled into the wilderneſſe to hide her ſelfe for a while.</p>
                  <p>This Concluſion may be further confirmed by ſundry other Texts of Scripture; and, 9. by Act. 20.7, 8, 9. There was ſuch a throng at St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, which he made in an upper Chamber in the night upon occaſion of his departure from <hi>Troas,</hi> that <hi>Eutychus,</hi> and doubtleſſe alſo ſome others were forced to ſit in the windows; note that this was in the night; what a throng might there have been, had it been on the Day time: out of all doubt, the Chamber would not have held them all: but certainly they could not meet every Lords-day in any one Roome, ſuch as were their places of meeting in thoſe times, and conſequently there muſt have been there more, then one of the Independent Congregationall Churches.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. We have alſo cleer Texts of Scripture to prove, that the Church is taken for a greater, then for any Independent Congregation, as <hi>Act.</hi> 8.1. <hi>And at that time, there was a great perſecution againſt the Church, that was at Hieruſalem;</hi> This Perſecution was not againſt one onely Independent Congregationall Church, but againſt the whole Churches of Iudea.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. So in the ſame Chap. verſ. 3. <hi>Saul made havocke of the Church.</hi> And chap. 9.1. <hi>breathing out threatnings and ſlaughter againſt the Diſciples of the Lord:</hi> now of this Church ſome members were in <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> v. 2. ſo he ſayes of himſelfe, I perſecuted the Church, 1. Cor. 15.9. Phil. 3.6. from whence I argue thus,</p>
                  <p>The Church that <hi>Saul</hi> perſecuted, was greater then a particular Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or an Independent Church.</p>
                  <p>But the Church here meant, is that which <hi>Saul</hi> perſecuted. <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Church here meant, is greater then a particular Congregation. The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor is certain; the Major I prove it; for he perſecuted not one onely parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Congregation, but that, wherever there were Diſciples of the Lord, chap. 9.1. in <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> chap. 8. verſ. 1.3. and in <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> chap. 9. v. 1.2.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. <hi>And,</hi> Act 12.1. <hi>Herod the King ſtretched out his hand to vex certaine of the Church.</hi> Here the word <hi>Church</hi> muſt ſignifie more, then a <hi>particular</hi> Congregation; for <hi>Herod</hi> did it to pleaſure the Iewes, which he could not have done, in vexing the members of <hi>one particular Church</hi> alone. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe here muſt be meant the <hi>Church,</hi> whereof <hi>Peter</hi> was a Member, v. 3. which was not one <hi>particular Church</hi> alone, but that of all <hi>Judea,</hi> ſince <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> had a particular Vocation, Miſſion, or Commiſſion to teach there, as <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Gentiles, Gal.</hi> 2.7. or rather of the whole <hi>Militant Church</hi> of their time, ſince they were <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> or <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſall Miniſters</hi> of the Goſpel.
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:124638:44"/>3. Becauſe if the <hi>Church</hi> here ſignifie a <hi>particular Church,</hi> whereof <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iames</hi> were Members; then that <hi>Church</hi> might have depoſed them of their Miniſtery: For the <hi>Independents</hi> grant this Authority to their Churches over their Paſtors: And if it be ſaid, that they have it over particular, but not over univerſall Paſtors, as the Apoſtles: <hi>Ergo.</hi> If they acknowledge them to be univerſall Paſtors, they muſt have univerſall Flocks, or <hi>Churches;</hi> ſo there was an univerſall Militant Church upon Earth, whereof they were Paſtors in their time, which is more then a <hi>particular Congregation.</hi> 4. Put the caſe they had been but Miniſters of <hi>particular Churches</hi> or <hi>Congregations,</hi> yet muſt the word <hi>Church</hi> there ſignifie a <hi>Church,</hi> whereof they were both Members, for ſuch a Church is meant here, v. 7.2, 3. But ſuch a <hi>Church</hi> muſt be more then a <hi>particular</hi> one, for it muſt containe both their <hi>Churches,</hi> and Perſons, ſince they are called ſome of the Church, i. e. of one Church.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. So verſ. 5. <hi>But Prayer was made without ceaſing of the Church unto God for him,</hi> i. e. for <hi>Peter,</hi> who was in Priſon; And out of all doubt this was not one onely Independent Church, but all the Churches that knew of <hi>Peters</hi> impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and depended upon him, as upon their Paſtor.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. <hi>Give no offence, neither to the Jewes, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the Church of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.32. which cannot be a ſimple <hi>Independent Church,</hi> but all the <hi>Churches</hi> we converſe with; 1. for Charity bindeth us to give no offence to all, or any of them. 2. Becauſe this <hi>Church</hi> is called the <hi>Church</hi> of God, which cannot be reſtrained to one <hi>particular Church,</hi> if they be all the Church of God. 3. Becauſe it is oppoſed to the Iewes, and the Gentiles.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. Becauſe the <hi>Church,</hi> wherein God did place Apoſtles, and Evangeliſts, 1. Cor. 12.28. was not an <hi>Independent Congregation,</hi> but more; for they were <hi>univerſall</hi> Miniſters of the Militant Church of their time; now if there be an univerſall Militant Church through all the world, how much rather may we admit a Provinciall or Nationall Church?</p>
                  <p n="16">16. <hi>I had rather ſpeak five words,</hi> ſaith St. Paul, <hi>with my underſtanding in the Church then,</hi> &amp;c. 1. Cor. 14.19. This Church, wherein the Apoſtle deſires to ſpeake, is more then an <hi>Independent Congregation;</hi> for he was not tyed to any particular Congregation.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. The Apoſtle willeth women to keepe ſilence in the Churches, 1.

                  <p>We may bring many other Paſſages of Scripture, and Reaſons; but becauſe they ſerve both for this, and the next Concluſion, therefore to decline repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, we remit them unto that Concluſion.</p>

                  <p>SEcondly I ſay,<note place="margin">Concluſ.</note> that betwixt the Churches of God, there ſhould be ſome Subordination in authority, i. e. ſuch, as wherein the judgements of inferior Churches, and their proceedings may be ſubject unto the judgement of the Superiour Church, whereunto they are Subordinate: And this may be proved ſufficiently from all the Teſtimonies of Scripture, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged for the former Concluſion; For if there be a <hi>Church</hi> more then a <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Congregationall,</hi> viz. <hi>Provinciall,</hi> or <hi>Nationall,</hi> out of all doubt, the <hi>particular Congregations</hi> muſt be ſubject to them, 1. becauſe a part is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto the whole, as the hand unto the whole body; <hi>nam pars magis ſui totius quam ſui;</hi> item, becauſe the part is for the whole, as a <hi>medium</hi> for its <hi>end:</hi> now the <hi>Mediums</hi> muſt be ſubject unto their <hi>Ends,</hi> and not the <hi>Ends</hi> unto their <hi>Mediums;</hi> and <hi>Media commenſurantur finibus, non fines Mediis;</hi> neither ſhape we the horſe back for the ſaddle, but the ſaddle for the horſe his back; ſo the government of particular Churches muſt not be ſhaped or fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med according to their particular exigencies and conveniencies alone, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of the whole Provinciall, Nationall, and Univerſall Militant Church here upon Earth, in ſuch a manner, that it hinder it not.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Particularly, it may be proved from the Cuſtome of the Old Teſtament, which is not abrogated in the New; for therein the Iudgements of Synagogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Aſſemblies were ſubject unto that of the middle Sanedrim; and that of the middle, to that of the Supreme: or if there were onely two, that of the leſſer Sanedrim unto that of the great one; as has been proved by Mr. <hi>Rutherford, Gilliſpy, Hearl,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Art.</hi> 1. and 2.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Repreſentative Church, or firſt Generall Councell, at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> had Power and Authority over all the Churches of the world; ſince it gave them a Miniſter, <hi>viz. Mathias: Ergo,</hi> All other Churches in their Iudgements and Power of creating ſuch a Miniſter, were ſubject unto it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> If it be ſaid, That it was an <hi>extraordinary Councell,</hi> 1. Becauſe it was indicted and convocated by Chriſt; 2. Becauſe it was compounded of extraordinary Perſons; 3. Becauſe the Perſons received extraordinary gifts there; 4. Becauſe, it was in the birth and beginning of the Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply.</hi> The Scripture ſaith not, That it was <hi>Extraordinary.</hi> As for the the Proofs; I anſwer to the firſt, 1. That howbeit it was <hi>indicted</hi> and <hi>convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated</hi> by Chriſt, yet was it not indicted and convocated in an <hi>extraordinary way.</hi> 2. That a Councell may be extraordinarily indicted and convocated, and yet be ordinary in its proceedings. 3. That the Indiction and Convocation of a Councell is Extrinſecall, and Antecedent to a Councell; becauſe that it is before that the Councell be; and therefore cannot make it Intrinſecally extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:124638:45"/>when it is exiſtent: So, <hi>Adam</hi> was made in an extraordinary way of Earth, and by creation; and <hi>Eva</hi> of <hi>Adams</hi> Rib; and yet they were not extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary perſons, in their nature, exiſtence, conſervation, or accidents. 4. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther read we, that it was convocated in an extraordinary way. 5. Neither can it be extraordinary, becauſe it was convocated by Chriſt; for by the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, all that ever Chriſt did to men, ſhould have been extraordinary.</p>
                  <p>To the ſecond, I have already anſwered.</p>
                  <p>To the third, I anſwer, 1. That the extraordinary gifts were <hi>perſonall</hi> only, and belonged unto the materiall parts of the Councell, and not to the form thereof; and therefore could not make it formally extraordinary, in quality of a Councell; for formall denominations are not taken from the matter, but from the form; ſo, if there be ſix or ſeven Eccleſiaſticall perſons aſſembled to dine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together, we call it not an Eccleſiaſtical Aſſembly. 2. I anſwer, That theſe extra ordinary gifts were ſubſequent unto the Councell, or at leaſt to that Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall proceeding, in the election of <hi>Mathias;</hi> Now that, which is ſubſequent to any thing, cannot denominate it formally, or at leaſt in the time precedent; when the Subject precedeth ſuch a ſubſequent Adjunct or Circumſtance. See more concerning this Argument heretofore.</p>
                  <p>To the fourth, I anſwer, 1. That all that, which was in the birth and infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the Church, was not <hi>Extraordinary;</hi> for by that reaſon, the Preaching of the Goſpel, and the Adminiſtration of the Sacraments ſhould have been Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary. 2. Things, that are Ordinary, muſt have a beginning. 3. And howſoever, at their beginning, they be Extraordinary in reſpect of time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, before their beginning, they were not Ordinary, but out of the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent order; yet they are Ordinary, in reſpect of Gods Ordinance or Law, which is <hi>ordinatio rationis,</hi> that ſhould be ordinary in Gods Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> If it be yet ſaid, That <hi>Mathias</hi> was an <hi>Extraordinary Miniſter,</hi> and his <hi>Vocation Extraordinary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, That all that is true; and yet, in this <hi>Extraordinary Vocation,</hi> there was ſomething <hi>Ordinary, viz.</hi> The <hi>Nomination,</hi> and <hi>Election,</hi> or <hi>Admittance</hi> of him to be a <hi>Miniſter</hi> of the Church, according to the Independents opinion, otherwayes their Argument ſhould be very impertinent, in proving from hence, the power of the people, in chooſing their Miniſters. That which there was <hi>Extraordinary,</hi> was not done by the Councell, and therefore could not make the Councell <hi>Extraordinary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As much may be ſaid of that Councell, that created ſeven Deacons for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Churches.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But principally we will urge that buſineſſe of <hi>Antioch,</hi> in that difference betwixt St. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> on the one part, and ſome <hi>Phariſees</hi> convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Chriſtian Faith, on the other. Hereupon it was reſolved that <hi>Paul and Barnabas ſhould go up to Jernſalem, unto the Apoſtles and Elders, about that queſtion,</hi> v. 2. they were <hi>ſent</hi> by the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> v. 3. they were received
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:124638:46"/>by the Church, and by the Apoſtles and Elders of the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> v. 4 the <hi>Aſſembly being gathered at Jeruſalem,</hi> the Cauſe was heard, v. 4.5. conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, v. 6. diſcuſſed, v. 7. voyced, v. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 judged, v. 22. the <hi>Iudgement,</hi> or <hi>Decree</hi> of the <hi>Councell</hi> or <hi>Aſſembly, ſent</hi> to <hi>Antioch,</hi> from the 22. v. to the 30. <hi>read,</hi> and <hi>obeyed</hi> by the <hi>Church</hi> at <hi>Antioch,</hi> &amp;c. v. 31. Here is the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Antioch, judged by a ſuperiour Church,</hi> at <hi>Ieruſalem;</hi> an <hi>Appeal,</hi> formed or interjected, from the one to the other; <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived</hi> by the other; <hi>judged</hi> and <hi>obeyed:</hi> And therefore it cannot be denyed, but there was ſome <hi>Subordination</hi> betwixt theſe <hi>two Churches,</hi> and that the one had authority over the other.</p>
                  <p>To this Argument ſome anſwer, 1. That if it prove any thing, it can only conclude an <hi>Appeal</hi> from one <hi>Pariſh Church,</hi> or particular Congregation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another, ſince the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and of <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> were no other then Pariſh Churches.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> 1. This Anſwer cannot hold, 1. Becauſe no ſuch thing can probably be collected out of this Text, or of any other in Scripture; and therefore it may be as eaſily rejected by us, as it is alleadged by them. 2. Becauſe hardly can it be proved, that in thoſe times <hi>Churches</hi> were divided into <hi>Pariſhes.</hi> 3. Becauſe an <hi>Appeale</hi> cannot be from one <hi>Pariſh</hi> or <hi>Congregationall Church</hi> unto another, ſince their authority is equall; but only from an inferior to a ſuperior Church or Judicatory. 4. Becauſe if it was from one particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation to another, then that Congregation, from which it was appealed, was not compleat in its Judgement, but had need of ſome Extrinſecall power, which is againſt the Tenets of Independents themſelves. 5. Becauſe if we might appeale from one particular Congregation to another, how much more from a particular Congregation unto a Synod, wherein the Spirit of God, and eſpecially that of Prophecie doth more abound. 6. Becauſe the Apoſtles in <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> were not members of any particular Church. 7. Becauſe, if the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> at <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> had been a <hi>particular</hi> or <hi>Congregationall</hi> Church, it could not have given out a <hi>Decree,</hi> which ſhould have bound ſo <hi>many Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> to obedience, viz. thoſe of <hi>Antioch, Syria,</hi> and <hi>Cilicia,</hi> v. 23.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It may be otherwayes anſwered, That it was an <hi>Appeale,</hi> but not to any <hi>Ordinary,</hi> but an <hi>Extraordinary</hi> Church, viz. to that of the <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> and that for theſe Reaſons. 1. Becauſe it was Extraordinarily gathered; 2. By Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary perſons; 3. It was compounded of Extraordinary perſons, viz. the Apoſtles; 4. Becauſe this Appeale was to the Apoſtles, who were infallible and Extraordinary Miniſters; 5. Becauſe it was in the birth, and beginning of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> 2. This Anſwer cannot hold, 1. Becauſe the Scripture declareth not, that this <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Aſſembly</hi> was <hi>Extraordinary.</hi> 2. Neither is it a ſatisfactory Anſwer, whenever we bring paſſages of Scripture to prove our Opinion, that they anſwer us, that they are of Extraordinary things, and practiſes; unleſſe
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:124638:46"/>the Scripture <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>clare them to be ſuch, or that they go beyond the generall Rules commanded in Scripture. 3. Becauſe here the proceedings are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme to thoſe, that we have in other Scriptures, as in the Old Teſtament &amp;c. As for the Reaſons; to the firſt I anſwer, that it cannot be proved, that it was extraordinarily gathered. 2. And howbeit it had been extraordinarily ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, yet the proceedings therein might have been, and were ordinary. 3. Becauſe the gathering or indicting of an Aſſembly is Extrinſecall unto an Aſſembly, and antecedent to it, and therefore cannot make it Intrinſecally extraordinary in its proceedings. 4. It is onely circumſtantiall, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make it extraordinary, <hi>quoad ſubſtantiam, ſed quoad modum,</hi> and that <hi>modus</hi> alſo is Extrinſecall; and not ſo much a manner of being of the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, as of him, or them, who indict, or gather it.</p>
                  <p>To the 2. <hi>Extraordinary Perſons,</hi> who gather an <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> are not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to make an <hi>Aſſembly extraordinary.</hi> 1. For then <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Churches</hi> ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered by the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> had been <hi>extraordinary,</hi> which is moſt falſe. 2. If they made it <hi>extraordinary,</hi> they muſt have imparted unto it ſome <hi>extraordinary quality,</hi> which they did not, or at leaſt, which appeareth not from Scripture; and ſo it muſt be holden as if it were not; for Scripture is onely a Rule to us in that which it ſayeth, and not in that which it ſayeth not.</p>
                  <p>To the 3. Becauſe it was compounded of <hi>extraordinary Perſons,</hi> viz. <hi>Apoſtles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This anſwer ſatisfieth not the Argument. 1. It is ridiculous to call all <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary,</hi> that maketh againſt them. 2. Becauſe it was not compounded of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> alone, but alſo of the <hi>Elders,</hi> verſ. 2.3. 3. Becauſe not onely the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> but alſo the <hi>Elders judged</hi> the buſineſſe, v. 2.3. 4. Howbeit this <hi>Appeale</hi> was to the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> yet was it not to them in quality of Apoſtles, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are we bound to beleeve it, ſince the Scripture hath no ſuch thing of it. 5. If it had been to the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> in quality of <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> or men, who were <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible,</hi> then could they not have <hi>appealed</hi> from <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Antioch,</hi> to the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles</hi> at <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> ſince he was as <hi>infallible</hi> at <hi>Antioch,</hi> as they all at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.</hi> 6. The <hi>judgement</hi> of the <hi>Elders</hi> had been <hi>ſuperfluous;</hi> for the <hi>judgement</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> alone, and their <hi>Letter</hi> alone, had ſufficed as <hi>Canonicall Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> to direct them at <hi>Antioch</hi> in their Proceedings: What needed they adde a <hi>fallible judgement</hi> to that, that was <hi>infallible,</hi> or mans judgement to Gods? and yet they contented not themſelves with that of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> alone. 7. If this Aſſembly at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> had been <hi>extraordinary,</hi> and <hi>infallible,</hi> becauſe it was compounded of <hi>extraordinary Perſons,</hi> viz. of <hi>Apoſtles. Ergo.</hi> ſo was that of <hi>Antioch,</hi> becauſe there was St. <hi>Paul</hi> an <hi>Apoſtle.</hi> 8. By the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, it muſt have been ordinary and fallible, becauſe it was compounded of <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary</hi> and <hi>fallible</hi> perſons, viz. the <hi>Elders.</hi> 9. If the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> had been there in quality of <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and <hi>infallible Miniſters,</hi> what needed they ſo long to conſult and diſpute in the Aſſembly, v. 10? A ſimple Deciſion, without any
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:124638:47"/>Conſultation might have ſufficed; for <hi>Diſputes</hi> and <hi>Conſultatio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                     </hi> amongſt men, are not of things, which they hold altogether certain, and out of doubt, but of things uncertain and doubtfull. 10. I deny the Conſequence, viz. That if a <hi>Councell</hi> or <hi>Aſſembly</hi> be compounded of <hi>extraordinary</hi> Perſons, <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary;</hi> for by the ſame reaſon, if there were ſeven, or eight <hi>Apoſtles</hi> dine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or ſleeping together, it ſhould be an <hi>extraordinary</hi> and <hi>Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> dinner or ſleeping. 11. Neither are all <hi>things,</hi> that are done by <hi>extraordinary Perſons, extraordinary;</hi> for the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> did <hi>eate, drinke,</hi> and <hi>ſleepe,</hi> neither yet was that <hi>Extraordinary Eating, Drinking, or Sleeeping,</hi> but ordinary, as in other men. 12. Becauſe the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were materiall parts, or members of the <hi>Aſſembly;</hi> their gifts, as <hi>infallibility</hi> and offices were perſonall, and denominated themſelves onely, and not every Aſſembly, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they were, or might be, for as the Forme that denominateth their perſons, belongeth onely to them, ſo doth the denomination proceeding from it. 13. Becauſe the parts of Aſſemblyes and Conſociations, may have contrary Formes and denominations, <hi>ſecundum entiatem,</hi> as we ſee in <hi>Republicks;</hi> for the whole <hi>Republick</hi> may be <hi>rich</hi> and <hi>potent,</hi> and the <hi>members</hi> thereof very <hi>poore,</hi> becauſe of the great <hi>Tributes</hi> they pay to the <hi>State,</hi> and the <hi>Statepoor;</hi> and the <hi>members</hi> or <hi>Subjects rich;</hi> becauſe of the <hi>Subjects great Trading and profit,</hi> and their ſmall <hi>Contributions</hi> to the <hi>State;</hi> So in the <hi>Church,</hi> in an <hi>Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> Aſſembly of Prophets, as that of <hi>Achab,</hi> there may be one Prophet <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible,</hi> yea, if there had been 400. yet that Councell had been; as it was, <hi>fallible,</hi> becauſe of the Plurality of the votes of the falſe Prophets; ſo an Army of 40000000. of Pigmees and Dwarfs is a great Army, and every one of them a little man.</p>
                  <p>To the 3. I have already anſwered.</p>
                  <p>To the 4. <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It was not to the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> in quality of Apoſtles, as I have proved it. 2. Becauſe it was alſo to the Elders. 3. I deny the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; for by the ſame reaſon it ſhould be <hi>ordinary,</hi> ſince it was to the Elders, who were ordinary Miniſters.</p>
                  <p>To the 5. 1. I deny the conſequence, for all things that were in the begining of the Church were not extraordinary, ſince many of them continue now as <hi>ordinary.</hi> 2. Becauſe if it be <hi>extraordinary,</hi> becauſe it was in the <hi>beginning</hi> of the Church, <hi>Ergo,</hi> all that we have in Chriſtian Religion muſt be Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, ſince there is no thing in it, but it had a Beginning: ſo Faith, Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Sacraments and all the Ordinary Miniſters of the Church ſhould be extraordinary, ſince they have a beginning with the Church. 3. Howbeit it was Extraordinary in reſpect of Time, as all things at their firſt Beginning, yet was it not Extraordinary in reſpect of Gods Law, which ordains it to be ordinary.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 3. This Argument may be other wayes eluded, in ſaying, that this buſineſſe was not judged at <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> by way of Appeale, but by way of Councell, not by Judges, but by Friends, and Brethren.</p>

                     <hi>Rep.</hi> But this <hi>Evaſton</hi> is no better then the reſt; 1. Becauſe the Text con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth no ſuch thing; and we cannot take it upon their word, no more then they will take it upon ours, unleſſe we prove it, as we here doe. 2. Becauſe heretofore we have ſhewn many, yea almoſt all the conditions neceſſary to an <hi>Appeale,</hi> whereof the reſt may be inferred by neceſſary conſequence. 3.

The <hi>Judgement</hi> in the Text is called a <hi>Decree.</hi> 5. If it had been but a <hi>Councell,</hi> the Phariſees might as well, yea more eaſily have rejected it, then the <hi>Iudgement</hi> at <hi>Antioch,</hi> which they did not, but acquieſced therein, for any thing we know to the contrary. 6. Some may peradventure prove it in this manner; That, if it had not been a <hi>Synod,</hi> and a ſuperior Iudicatory in reſpect of <hi>Antioch,</hi> thoſe of <hi>Antioch</hi> had not ſent the <hi>two Parties,</hi> but had done better, to have ſent ſome <hi>indifferent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;</hi> for <hi>indifferent Perſons</hi> are more proper to conſult a buſineſſe, then the <hi>Parties.</hi> 7. If it had been <hi>judged</hi> at Hieruſalem by way of <hi>Counſell</hi> only, this <hi>Counſell</hi> had likely been only given to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Antioch;</hi> for <hi>counſell</hi> ordinarily is only given to thoſe, who deſire and crave it: But ſo it is not here, for the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> not only <hi>judged</hi> ſo concerning the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Antioch</hi> alone, but alſo of <hi>all others;</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and their <hi>Diſciples urged</hi> this <hi>Iudgement</hi> upon all the reſt of the <hi>Churches,</hi> where they paſſed.</p>
                  <p>Some <hi>New-England</hi> Preachers anſwer, That this <hi>Aſſembly</hi> at Hieruſalem <hi>cleer up the truth dogmatically;</hi> for the word tranſlated <hi>Decrees,</hi> is in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.S. Anſw.</hi> This cannot hold, 1. For whoever have a <hi>Dogmaticall power,</hi> they have alſo a power to <hi>Cenſure;</hi> for he who may <hi>judge,</hi> that this muſt be believed, and according to Gods Word, meriteth ſuch an Eccleſiaſticall or Spirituall puniſhment, wherefore may he not alſo ſentence the <hi>Delinquents,</hi> who merit to be ſo <hi>cenſured?</hi> 2.

We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſubmit Gods Cauſe to others, then to whom he hath ſubmitted it himſelf. How could they accept them for Iudges, who had no vocation of God to judge them?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Arbitrary Iudges,</hi> that are given, have a <hi>Superiour power</hi> over the <hi>Church,</hi> that they <hi>judge;</hi> and ſo ye acknowledge, that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> had <hi>power</hi> over that of <hi>Antioch,</hi> if that of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was an <hi>Arbiter datus aut delegatus.</hi> 2.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> 1. This is not true, 1. Becauſe all this is ſaid without Scripture. 2. And <hi>verſ.</hi> 24. it is not ſaid, That theſe <hi>Phariſees</hi> pretended to have had any ſuch charge from the <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> but the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> ſay, That they gave them no ſuch command: But this Argument may ſeem ſomewhat weak; for howſoever the Text have it not <hi>in terminis,</hi> yet ſeems it to follow of the Text by a <hi>Morall neceſſity;</hi> for that expreſſion, <hi>To whom we gave no ſuch commandment,</hi> ſeemeth to preſuppoſe ſome pretention of a <hi>commandment</hi> on the <hi>Phariſees</hi> part. 3. And howbeit it is ſaid, That they went out from the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> yet is it not ſaid, they were Members of the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> 4. Neither read we, That there was any diſpute about their <hi>Meſſage,</hi> or <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> but about their <hi>Doctrine.</hi> 5. Becauſe the <hi>Sentence</hi> or <hi>Decree</hi> is onely about their <hi>Doctrine.</hi> 6. Becauſe in that <hi>Decree,</hi> not onely the <hi>Phariſees</hi> are ſentenced, but all the <hi>Churches;</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the Obſervation of the <hi>Canons</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> is enjoyned; onely there is a word, in paſſing, ſaid of the <hi>Phariſees;</hi> but however it be, that was no way the <hi>principall</hi> Queſtion.</p>
                  <p>Finally, here cometh in <hi>M. S.</hi> in an ordinary Independent way, never proving any thing Poſitively, that they beleeve (for in this point, they ſhew themſelves the weakeſt of all Sectaries) but ever more denying what we prove, which requires no great abilities, as is known and confeſſed amongſt all men, that do but pretend to learning; neither can they do otherwayes; for they will not be tyed in time to come to any Poſitive Doctrine, no not ſo much as to that they hold at this preſent, for any thing I can collect from the <hi>Apologeticall Narration:</hi> onely they ſtand ſtoutly to ſome <hi>Nego's,</hi> and will, that we prove all, and they nothing at all.</p>
                  <p>He telleth us then in the third Chapter of his Book, that before this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ours <hi>Acts</hi> 15. can hold, we have ten Particulars to prove; 1.

That the <hi>Members</hi> of this <hi>Synod</hi> were ſent hereunto by the <hi>particular Churches,</hi> over whom they claimed <hi>juriſdiction.</hi> 5. That onely <hi>Church-men</hi> had <hi>power</hi> to <hi>ſit</hi> there. 6. That it had as well <hi>power</hi> to make <hi>Laws</hi> of things
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:124638:49"/>
                     <hi>indifferent,</hi> as to impoſe things <hi>neceſſary.</hi> 7. That the <hi>Churches of Syria,</hi> and <hi>Cilicia,</hi> had their <hi>Delegats ſitting</hi> there. 8. That <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas ſate</hi> as <hi>Commiſſioners,</hi> for the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Antioch.</hi> 9. That <hi>ordinary Synods</hi> may <hi>proceed,</hi> as they did, in ſaying, <hi>It ſeemed good,</hi> &amp;c. 10. That theſe <hi>words</hi> in the cloſe of the <hi>Epiſtle, ye ſhall do well, verſe</hi> 29. did import ſome <hi>intimation,</hi> That if they did not <hi>ſubmit,</hi> ſome <hi>further courſe</hi> muſt be taken with them. <hi>Item,</hi> In this Chapter he telleth us, That <hi>Presbyterians</hi> agree not about the Pedigree of their Government; and to tell us all this, he imployeth no leſſe, then ten Pages in Quarto in a very ſmall Print.</p>
                  <p>As for the firſt, we have already proved it ſufficiently, and attend his reply; As for that ridiculous demand of his, that we prove, That the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> waved and ſilenced the Spirit of Infallibility.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> They might have it, and not wave it, howbeit they ſate not there in quality of men that had it; for the Elders that had it not, ſate there in the ſame quality with them. Some diſpute alſo, 1. Whether the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> in all times, and in all places, and upon all occaſions, yea, ſleeping and ſick, had the gift of Infallibility in <hi>actu ſecundo,</hi> ſo that their <hi>will</hi> could not hinder the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Act. See the Example of <hi>Nathan,</hi> S. <hi>Peter, Thomas, &amp;c.</hi> who had the gift of Infallibility in <hi>actu primo;</hi> but ſundry times they had it not in <hi>actu ſecundo.</hi> 2. Some doubt alſo, what is the gift of Propheſie or Infallibility; Whether it be liker unto an Habitude, which is a Permanent quality, or to a Paſſion or Afflatus, which is not Permanent, but ſuddenly flies away.</p>
                  <p>To the ſecond: 1. It is but a circumſtance of time, which followeth neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily of the ſubſtance of the thing. 1. For if Councells ſit, they muſt ſit in ſome time; but in what time, whether once, twice, or thrice a yeer, that depends upon other Circumſtances, as of Church opportunities, and exigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, of the Civill Magiſtrates Permiſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. In things Circumſtantiall, Diſcipline depends on the Law of Nature according to the Apologiſts own Confeſſion.</p>
                  <p>To the third; It may be neceſſarily inferred of the Authoritative power; for where there is an Authoritative power to <hi>judge,</hi> and <hi>cenſure,</hi> there is ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more an Authoritative power of <hi>citation,</hi> and <hi>calling</hi> of all thoſe, who are within the compaſſe of ſuch a juriſdiction; for <hi>citation</hi> is a <hi>medium,</hi> whereby we come to <hi>judgement;</hi> and it is a maxime moſt certain, that <hi>Media accipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt ſuam neceſſitatem a fine; finis mediis conciliat amabilitatem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To the fourth; Some think it very probable, that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were ſent thither from <hi>Antiochia:</hi> but <hi>Paul</hi> was not Miniſter of any particular Church; no more was <hi>Barnabas,</hi> for any thing we read in Scripture; and therefore appearingly, they could not be ſent from <hi>Antioch,</hi> a their particular Miniſters; but ſince they were alſo Univerſall Miniſters, they might receive a particular Commiſſion from particular Churches, ſince the Apoſtolate, the charge of an Evangeliſt, and Prophet, contain in themſelves virtually the charges of ordinary Miniſters.</p>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:124638:50"/>
                  <p>If it be ſaid, That they were Party, and therefore could not ſit as Judges; It may be anſwered, That men cannot be taken for Party, when they compear before the Synod; and when they are taken for Party by Innovators and Sectaries onely, and perſevere in the Doctrine already received in the Church; for if that were admitted, That every man promiſcuouſly might be taken for Party, then might a Felon, or Traytor, take all his Judges for Party, and ſo never be judged: and therefore in Iudgement, when any one will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the Sentence of his Iudges, and take them for Party, his Reaſons are examined and conſidered, whether they be of force and validity, or not. 2. It may be, that they were choſen to be Members in the Synod, before that this diſpute fell out. 3. It is not needfull, that we prove all ſingular Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances from Scripture: It will ſerve our turn if we prove, That it was ſome Occumenick, Nationall, or Provinciall Synod, from whence we may infer, by neceſſary conſequence, that Commiſſioners were ſent from particular Churches thereunto. Now whether S. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were there in qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Commiſſioners, it is not needfull to know. 4. This Aſſembly was a Generall, or Nationall Aſſembly, as we have proved: <hi>Ergo,</hi> Either it was a ſet Aſſembly, as the Popes Conſiſtory; or as a Chapter; or ſuch as we have taken it for: But ye deny the firſt two: <hi>Ergo,</hi> Ye muſt grant the third, or give ſome other. 5. Ye your ſelves admit Synods, to which particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations ſend their Commiſſioners, Delegates, or Meſſengers, call them, as it pleaſes you: <hi>Ergo,</hi> Ye cannot deny them; If ye deny their quality or power to judge, that is another queſtion, which is different from this.</p>
                  <p>To the fifth, I prove it, For no man hath power to judge in Eccleſiaſticall Cauſes, but they who have the abilities, ſuch as are onely Church Officers; becauſe no man can take this office, but he who is called, as <hi>Aaron;</hi> ſuch as are not every one of the people; amongſt whom, as ye ſay, many have not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence enough, but are timorous, and others are rude or impertinent. If ye had anſwered all my Book, ye might have found more Reaſons: but of this you are like to hear more, God willing, in a particular Queſtion.</p>
                  <p>To the ſixth, This Councell impoſed upon the <hi>Church</hi> ſome things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of their own Nature, as that of abſtaining from blood, and things ſtrangled; for howſoever they were neceſſary, <hi>neceſſitate praecepti,</hi> in ſo far as commanded; yet were they not neceſſary in themſelves, or <hi>neceſſitate medii;</hi> and ſo they are called in the Text, <hi>things neceſſary,</hi> partly <hi>neceſſitate praecepti,</hi> partly of conveniency, or remedy, for to avoide offence: Some call it <hi>neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas non facti, ſed facientis,</hi> when the thing of it ſelf is not needfull, but the Agent maketh it neceſſary to himſelf, as we do, in abſtaining from things, whereat our Brethren may take offence, howbeit we give them none. 2. Your Independent Church taketh that Authority unto her ſelf, as when ſhe ordains a certain day, and a certain hour, for her Sermons and meetings: Wherefore then may not a Synod do it? 3. The Church by Gods Authority,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:124638:50"/>may ordaine of things Neceſſary; ſo may ſhe of things Indifferent, when they may conduce to a thing that is neceſſary; <hi>Nam media accipiunt neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem à fine.</hi> 4. For howſoever ſome things be indifferent in generall, yet are they not ſuch in particular, in matter of Practice; for then they become neceſſary, becauſe of ſome particular determinations, and references, that they have to ſome good ends, in reſpect of time, place, perſons, &amp;c. 5. This is but one only Point of Presbyterian Government, and not all; and howbeit ye ſhould gaine all this, (as ye doe not) yet would it not follow, that the Presbyterian Diſcipline were abſolutely to be condemned.</p>
                  <p>To the 7. The Proofs of the 4. may prove this alſo. 1. For if it was a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciall, Nationall, or Generall Synod or Councell, every Church concerned therein, muſt have had their Commiſſioners. 2. Ye your ſelves acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Synods to have a Synodicall authority, (howbeit, not as we) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto ye ſend your Meſſengers, as ye call them: and therefore, what right ye claime to ſend your Meſſengers, the ſame had the Churches of <hi>Syria,</hi> and <hi>Cilicia,</hi> to ſend theirs to <hi>Hieruſalem;</hi> but if they did it not, the more were they to blame for ſuch neglect: Now it ſufficeth me, to prove that they had power, and were bound to ſend their Commiſſioners thither.</p>
                  <p>To the 8. I anſwer, 1. It is not needfull we prove, that <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were Commiſſioners at <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> for the Church of <hi>Antioch:</hi> It may be, that they were their Commiſſioners; it may be, that they had ſome others. 2. It ſufficeth, that they had power to ſend their Commiſſioners thither, and were bound to doe it: And this bindeth them to ſubmit themſelves to their Decrees. 3. This Diſputer is abſurd, whereas he will oblige us to prove every particular, yea individuall Circumſtance: It is a common Maxime, that, <hi>de ſingularibus non datur ſcientia:</hi> The Scripture obligeth us not to know all the ſingular Circumſtances of every thing it propounds; but it delivereth us Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuments of all things neceſſary unto Salvation, which either contain formally, or from whence may be concluded all that we are bound to know, either di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, or indirectly, and <hi>per deductionem ad impoſſibile,</hi> mediately or imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately.</p>
                  <p>To the 9. I anſwer, that every particular Miniſter may preach, and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh in the name of God; for they are all Ambaſſadours of God: <hi>We are Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours for Chriſt, as though God did beſeech you by us; We pray you in Chriſts ſtead, be ye reconciled to God,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.20. It is alſo ſaid, that <hi>the Lord did work with them,</hi> Mark. 16.20. and that they are <hi>co-operators, or labourers together with the Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.9. Since therefore they are <hi>Gods co-operators,</hi> or <hi>labourers with the Lord,</hi> and the Lord with them, yea in their Deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Iudgements, and Preachings; wherefore may they not ſay, <hi>it ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt, and to us,</hi> viz. to the Holy Ghoſt, as the prime cauſe, and to them, as to his Miniſters and Ambaſſadors; yea, if it ſeemeth good to the Holy Ghoſt, it ſhould ſeem good to all his Miniſters. 2. And I pray you,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:124638:51"/>
                     <hi>M.S.</hi> when it ſeemeth good to an Independent Miniſter to declare the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, that denieth Chriſts Divinity, hereticall, whether think you, ſeemes it not good to God, and to the Holy Ghoſt alſo? and if it ſeem good to both, why may not the Miniſter ſay. It ſeemeth good to God, and to me alſo, to declare this Hereticall? 3. And if that is bound, or looſed in Heaven, which the Church bindeth, or looſeth on Earth; wherefore, when they bind, or looſe ſinners, may they not ſay, It ſeemeth good to God, and to me alſo, to looſe this ſinner?</p>
                  <p>To the 10. I anſwer, It is altogether ridiculous; for, this one particular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion conteineth not all the expreſſions that are uſed in Eccleſiaſticall Iudgements; the Church uſeth not evermore Comminations in her Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but againſt ſuch as are diſobedient, and that after ſundry Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; Neither is every Iudgement or Law evermore expreſly Penall, as ye might have learned both out of your Civill, and Canon Law.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> Wherein the ſame Doctrine is further confirmed by Reaſon.</head>
                  <p>THis Subordination of Eccleſiaſticall Iudicatories, may be likewiſe proved by the practice of the Old Teſtament; for in the Old Teſtament, there were Synagogicall and Synedriall Iudicatories; amongſt them there was a Subordination, and from the firſt they appealed to the ſecond; neither find we ever, that God abrogated it, ſince it was not Ceremoniall, as I have ſhewed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It may likewiſe be proved from the Subordination of Civill Iudicatories, in all great Civill States; and there is a like reaſon for them both.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If it be granted, that there are Eccleſiaſticall Aſſemblies greater in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority one then another, as appeareth by all theſe former Texts; either this inequality of Greatneſſe or Power is by <hi>Co-ordination,</hi> or by <hi>Subordination:</hi> But it cannot be by <hi>Co-ordination;</hi> for one co-ordinate Power hath no power over the other, as that of <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> had over the reſt of the Churches, in giving them a Paſtor, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.2. &amp; 6. chap. and Lawes and Commands, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. &amp; 16. <hi>Ergo,</hi> It muſt be by <hi>Subordination;</hi> And then the power of the ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Church is under that of the ſuperior Church, whereunto it is ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, as in Civill Iudicatories, ſubordinated one to another.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If there were no Subordination of Eccleſiaſticall Iudicatories, in matters of Power and Authority, or their Authoritative Power; then any particular Congregation, by an irreſiſtible power, in deſpite of all the Churches of the the World, might eſtabliſh amongſt themſelves all ſort of moſt damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Hereſies, commit all ſort of ſinne and uncleanneſſe, and ſo infect all the World with their wickedneſſe, and no Churches, or Chriſtians, <hi>qua
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:124638:51"/>tales,</hi> could hinder them, or ſay to them (even as the Pope pretends they cannot ſay to him) <hi>Domine, quare hoc facis?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. But can our Adverſaries, riſen up of the new, ſhew any ſuch Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as theirs in the Church of God, in any time, ſince Chriſts Incarnation, yea, from the Creation of the World to this time, wherein there was no Subalternation, but a meer Independency amongſt all Eccleſiaſticall Iudica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories?</p>
                  <p>We could wiſh they would ſhew us the Inſtitution of it in Scripture, where any where Chriſt commanded, that all Churches ſhould be altogether Independent, and conſequently Incorrigible? Where at any time he granted them ſuch a Licenciouſneſſe of power to go irreſiſtably to Hell?</p>
                  <p>What an abominable Licenciouſneſſe is this, to plead on this manner, for all ſort of Independency, and of Eccleſiaſticall Impunity, in doing of all ſort of wickedneſſe and miſchief.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The want of this Subordination taketh away all ſort of remedy againſt the offences of particular Congregations.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. It deſtroyeth the Unitie of the Militant viſible Church, both Provinciall, Nationall, and Univerſall; which cannot appear, but in a Provinciall, Nation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, or Univerſall Synod, or Councell.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. And conſequently, the viſibility of the <hi>Church,</hi> for ſhe is not viſible, but in her Symbole or Confeſſion of Faith, and Canons of Eccleſiaſticall Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, as appeareth by the Symbole of the Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. To take away ſuch Repreſentative Churches, as Synods, is to deſtroy the Externall Church-Communion of Saints, or the Communion of Saints amongſt divers Churches, which cannot ſo well appear, as in Synods, where their <hi>Reall Communion</hi> one with another is beſt repreſented; for if particular <hi>Churches</hi> be deſtroyed by perſecution, and a little remnant eſcape, as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it falleth out upon the <hi>Turks</hi> Invaſion, and the Papiſts Maſſacres, as wofull experience hath furniſhed us but too many examples in <hi>Germany, France, England,</hi> and elſewhere, what Externall Union or Communion of Saints can appear amongſt you; ſince in ſuch a caſe ye will neither receive men in age to the Lords Table, nor the children of ſuch Martyrs to Baptiſm; and ſo all the recompence they can have amongſt you for all their ſufferings for the Name of Chriſt, is, That they are like to be utterly excluded from all Church-Communion whatſoever.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. So this is a very poor comfort for Martyrs, who having ſuffered much in their own perſons, loſt their wives, children, and goods, for the good Name of Chriſt, ſhall no more now be eſteemed Chriſtians after all their ſufferings, whereas they were thought to be of the very beſt before that time.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Such a Subordination of <hi>Repreſentative Churches</hi> in matter of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is a means very neceſſary to conſerve the <hi>Churches;</hi> for by the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritative
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:124638:52"/>power thereof <hi>Churches</hi> are kept in Order, Unitie, and Union, and ſo preſerved, as we ſee in <hi>France, Holland, Scotland,</hi> and elſewhere, ever ſince the beginning of the World; whereas by the contrary Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent way, conſiſting of diſ-union, they may eaſily be deſtroyed, as we ſee in the innumerable number of Sects, that in a ſhort ſpace of time have ſprouted out of the Independent Sect; no leſſe oppoſite one to another, then to us.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. If there be no Subordination of Eccleſiaſticall Aſſemblies, but every one be Independent, and every member of the Church have a vote in all Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall matters, and be made acquainted with all that paſſeth, as amongſt the Independents; hardly can the Counſels, and the Reſolutions, that are taken for mutuall conſervation, be kept ſecret, but they will every houre be betrayed, and ſo the Church given up to her Enemies: which appearingly cannot ſo eaſily fall out in the Synodicall way, wherein 20. 30. or 40. only, and thoſe of the beſt ſort, and the wiſeſt men, are acquainted with the buſineſſe: for, in all morall probability, it is not credible, but 20. 30. or 40. may better keep a buſineſſe ſecret, then 20000. or 30000, whereof the Churches that they repreſent, may be compounded.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. Since Chriſt ordained Univerſall Miniſters to rule over the whole Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant Church, and all the particular Congregations thereof, wherefore ſhould there not be ſome unity of Government amongſt them? and wherefore may they not all depend on one Councell, as well as on one man? certainly, there is the ſame reaſon for both; for as the Apoſtles, under the notion of Apoſtles, and Church-Miniſters, endowed with extraordinary gifts, and namely of Infallibility, governed the whole Church extraordinarily: ſo doe Generall Councels, endowed with ordinary gifts, govern it ordinarily.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. I would willingly enquire of the Independents, to what Church were added ſo many <hi>thouſands,</hi> that were <hi>baptized</hi> by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and <hi>added unto the Church in one day?</hi> Whether to a Particular Congregation, or to a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Eccleſiaſticall Conſociation? It could not be to a Particular Congregation, 1. For the Reaſons I have already produced. 2. Becauſe the Apoſtles were not Particular, but Univerſall Miniſters, ſet over the Univerſall Militant Church; and therefore, in vertue of their charge, admitted them to be Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of all the Churches, whereof they were Miniſters. 3. Becauſe they were of divers and ſundry Countries: neither is it credible, that to be a <hi>Member</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> they were bound to quit their Countries, and to ſtay at Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, howſoever ſo long as they did ſtay there, they might participate as well of all the reſt of Gods Ordinances, as of Baptiſme: <hi>Ergo,</hi> they were added to ſome greater Conſociation, viz. to that, and to all thoſe, whereof the Apoſtles were Miniſters; for out of all doubt, the Apoſtles, who baptized them, could not refuſe to admit them unto the Lords Table, wherever they ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated the Sacrament.</p>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:124638:52"/>
                  <p>If it be anſwered, That this Argument only proveth a greater Reall, but not a greater Repreſentative Church.</p>
                  <p>I reply, That directly only it proveth a greater <hi>Reall,</hi> viz. an <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſall Militant Church;</hi> but yet, by conſequence, it proveth alſo a <hi>Repreſentative Church</hi> of the ſame extent; for every <hi>Reall Church</hi> may be repreſented in its <hi>Commiſſioners,</hi> or <hi>Meſſengers</hi> (as ye call them) that meet in a <hi>Synod.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If it be yet anſwered, that this may prove a greater Repreſentative Church, but not endowed with any <hi>Authoritative power.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I reply, It is a power of Iudging, which muſt be <hi>Authoritative,</hi> and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be meerly <hi>Conſultative,</hi> ſuch as is that of every Tinker, who may give counſell to a Church; and that of one Church, which hath power to give counſell to a thouſand, yea, to ten thouſand, repreſented in a <hi>Synod;</hi> for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches, being parts of the whole Provinciall, Nationall, or Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Militant Church, muſt be ſubject to the whole; for it is a <hi>Maxime</hi> in <hi>Philoſophie,</hi> that <hi>Totum non ſubjicitur parti, ſed pars toti;</hi> Item, <hi>Totum non regitur motu partis, ſed Pars Totius:</hi> And they diſtinguiſh between the Univerſall, and Particular Inclination of things, and tell us, That a <hi>part</hi> doth ſometimes quit its Particular Inclination, to be ruled according to the Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the <hi>whole;</hi> as when <hi>water,</hi> which according to its Particular Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation deſcends, yet to avoid the <hi>vacuum</hi> (whereof might enſue the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of the world) againſt its Particular Inclination, but according to its Univerſall Inclination, as it is for the Totall, it aſcends: And ſo it is, or ſhould be in Politicall, and all Spirituall Conſociations; for the <hi>parts</hi> cannot be conſerved, but in the <hi>whole.</hi> The Politicians alſo tell us, that <hi>Lex paerticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laris cedit generali;</hi> ſo Laws, that concern Particular Caſes or Conſociations, muſt give place to the generall Law of more generall Caſes, and Conſociati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for the generall good of Conſociations, is to be preferred before the Particular good of Particular Perſons, or Particular Conſociations.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. All the Churches here upon Earth make up one Republike, tyed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Faith, Charity, and other Particular Chriſtian vertues; as that in Heaven another: Now it is a <hi>Maxime</hi> in <hi>Politicks, Salus Reipub. ſuprema Lex eſto. Ergo,</hi> There muſt be one Law, common to this whole Chriſtian Republike: If ſo, <hi>Ergo,</hi> There muſt be ſome viſible Iudges to judge accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this Law, otherwayes in vain ſhould we have it; Now this viſible Iudge can be no other, but a <hi>Synod;</hi> For if ye ſay, it is <hi>Chriſt,</hi> then we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be legally Iudged, according to this Law, till the day of Iudgement, when <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall Iudge the quick and the dead; which is moſt ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. <hi>C. C.</hi> acknowledgeth, That by Baptiſm we are made Members of the Univerſall Militant Church, and conſequently Subjects of ſome Chriſtian Republike: <hi>Ergo,</hi> There are ſome Iudges to judge ſuch Subjects: But thoſe Iudges are not in one Particular Church; for by Baptiſm, as he ſayeth, They
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:124638:53"/>are not admitted to the ſocietie of any Particular <hi>Church. Ergo,</hi> They muſt be judged by ſome greater Repreſentative <hi>Church,</hi> which muſt be either <hi>Claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicall, Provinciall, Nationall,</hi> or <hi>Oecumenicall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="17">17. It is a generall Rule of S. <hi>Paul</hi> in matter of <hi>Church Government, That the Spirits of Prophets be ſubject to Prophets,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14 32. Which cannot at all, or at leaſt cannot eaſily, and commodiouſly be obtained in the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Oppoſition, or Coordination, as in ſome Subordination of Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Aſſemblies or Iudicatories; for when all are equall, there is no ſubjection of one to another.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. This Doctrine of Subordination of Inferiour Eccleſiaſticall Iudicato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to their Superiours, with a Coordination of Inferiour Iudicatories, or Eccleſiaſticall Aſſemblies amongſt themſelves, is moſt convenient to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Sacraments, in receiving unto them all ſuch, as are our Brethren in <hi>Chriſt;</hi> whereas a meer Oppoſition, Independency, or at moſt a Coordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of <hi>Churches,</hi> founded on a meer will and charitie, without any Law, is repugnant to it, in ſo far forth, as it debarreth from them ſuch as are worthy to be received.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. The Apoſtle commands, That <hi>all things be done decently, and in order,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.40. And telleth us, That <hi>God is not the Author of Confuſion, but of Peace, Verſ.</hi> 33. Now, where there is no <hi>Subordination</hi> of <hi>Eccleſiaſticall Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catories;</hi> When none of them is ſubject one to another, but they are all equall; when one <hi>Church,</hi> be ſhe never ſo corrupted in life and Doctrine, hath as great Authority over all the <hi>Churches</hi> of the World, repreſented together in a <hi>Synod,</hi> be they never ſo ſound in their life and Doctrine, as they all have over her, What can be done decently and in order? I adjure you all, tell me in Conſcience, Whether ye think that God can be the Author of any ſuch order, or rather of ſo abominable a confuſion.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. I could ſhew, how that this Subordination is moſt convenient, and the contrary Independency, Oppoſition, or Coordination of <hi>Churches</hi> founded on mans meer will, is moſt repugnant, 1. unto the perfection, that appeareth in all Gods Works, both in thoſe of Nature, and of Grace: 2. To Gods Truth and Wiſdom, in giving no better means for redreſſing of Offences. 3. To his Iuſtice, in making of Laws, that cannot ſuppreſſe Hereſies, and all ſort of wickedneſſe in diſordered <hi>Churches.</hi> 4. To his Mercy, that in fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing us ſo graciouſly ſo many means, and helps to Salvation, he ſhould have given us this Independent Anarchy, to croſſe them all, yea, to lead us irreſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to Hell. 5. To his Providence, in providing of means, ſo diſproportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, and incommenſurated for ſo excellent an end, <hi>viz.</hi> for the peace of the <hi>Church;</hi> means more fit to trouble, then to procure her peace, and to put all the <hi>Churches</hi> of God in confuſion, rather then in order.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. Is it credible, that God ſhould have given his Son to death, to purchaſe us an Order, whereby all Churches might live in Peace and Unity, and yet

Note therefore I pray thee, courteous Reader, that Independency is a ſort of Eccleſiaſtical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, whereby every particular Church is ruled by its Miniſter, its Doctor, ſome Ruling Elders, and all thoſe, who are admitted to be Members thereof, who, how Heterodox, and Haereticall ſoever they be in Doctrine, and how wicked and damnable ſoever they be in their Lives, will not yet ſubmit to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Eccleſiaſticall power whatſoever, yea not to that of all the Churches of the world, were they never ſo Orthodox and holy in their lives.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Note, that the reaſon, wherefore they will not ſubmit to any Eccleſiaſticall authority, according to their opinion, is not out of any diſobedience in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as they pretend, but for want of authority in the Churches; for they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that howbeit any particular Church, or any of her members ſhould fal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to never ſo damnable Hereſies, or wickedneſſe, that yet God hath not ordained any authoritative power to judge her; but that her power is as great, as that of all the Churches in the world; and that all that they can do in ſuch a caſe, is no more, but only to Counſell her, as ſhe may do them; and in caſe ſhe will not
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:124638:54"/>follow their Counſell, that they ought to do nothing elſe, but onely declare, that they will have no more communion with her, as ſhe may likewiſe do to them in the like caſe, viz. if they will not follow her Advice, when ſhe is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with their Doctrine, Government, Life, or Proceedings.</p>
                  <p>The Queſtion then betwixt us, and them, is, whether God hath eſtabliſhed any ſuch Independent Government in his Church, or not.</p>

                     <hi>A. S.</hi> I am bound to your courteſie, good Sir, that will not let my weake Reaſons appeare in Front againſt your ſtrong Anſwers: But ſince it is not <hi>M.

                     <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Reaſons againſt the Independency of Particular Congregations.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. THe Independent Churches have no ſufficient remedy for miſcariages, though never ſo groſſe; no reliefe for wrongfull Sentences, or Perſons injured by them; no Powerfull or Effectuall meanes to reduce a Church, or Churches, that fall into Hereſie, or Schiſme, &amp;c. All that they can doe, is only to pronounce a <hi>Sentence</hi> of <hi>Non-Communion</hi> againſt <hi>Delinquent Churches,</hi> as on the other ſide, <hi>Delinquent Churches</hi> may doe againſt them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This Remedy is new, neither was it known to the Independent Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, before that emergent Caſe in <hi>Holland,</hi> related in the <hi>Apologeticall Narration:</hi> for if that Church offending had known ſo much, it is not cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, that ſhe would, againſt all charity, and the common Order of all Churches, have committed ſo great a Scandall.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This Remedy is not ſufficient, nor ſatisfactory, becauſe all Churches,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:124638:54"/>according to your Tenets, are equall in Authority, independent one of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; and <hi>Par in parem non habet imperium,</hi> None hath power or authority over his Equall; How then could any Church binde another to any ſuch Account, but out of its free will, as a Party may doe to its Party?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Becauſe the Churches, that are, or that pretend to be offended by a Delinquent Church, cannot judge her, for then they become both Iudge, and Party in one cauſe, which cannot be granted to thoſe who have no <hi>Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative power</hi> one over another; as when a Private man offendeth the State, and We our God.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. What if many Churches, yea all the Churches ſhould offend one, ſhould that one Church gather all the reſt together, judge them all, and in caſe of not ſubmitting themſelves to her judgement, ſeparate her ſelfe from them all? If ſo, we ſhould have Separations and Schiſmes enough, which ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to all Poſteritie to come.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. What if Churches were ſo remote one from another, that they could not ſo eaſily meet together upon every occaſion? Then there ſhould be no Remedy, at leaſt no eaſie Remedy.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. What if the Offence were ſmall? Should ſo many Churches, for every trifle, gather together, and put themſelves to ſo great coſt and trouble?</p>
                  <p n="8">8. What if the Churches ſhould differ in their Iudgements, one from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other? In ſuch a caſe, ſhould they all, by Schiſmes, ſeparate themſelves one from another?</p>
                  <p n="9">9. This ſort of Government giveth no more Power or Authority to a thouſand Churches over one, then to a Tinker, yea, to a Hangman, over a thouſand; for he may deſire them all, out of charitie, to give an account of their Iudgement, in caſe he be offended by them; Neither ſee I what more our Brethren grant to all the Churches of the World over one.</p>
                  <p>But the Presbyteriall Government is ſubject to none of theſe inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences; for the collective or combined Elderſhip having an Authoritative power, all men and Churches thereof are bound by Law and Covenant to ſubmit themſelves thereunto: Every man knoweth their ſet times of meeting, wherein ſundry matters are diſpatched, and all things caried by Plurality of Voyces, without any Schiſme or Separation.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. This Government, viz. <hi>Iedependency,</hi> is a Power, wherein the Party is judged, if he will; and ſo the Iudgement of the Iudges ſuſpended upon the Iudgement of the Party judged; which is moſt ridiculous, without any exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in Civill, or Eccleſiaſticall Iudicatories: a Iudgement not very unlike to that, which is related of a merry man, who ſaid, That he had the beſt, and moſt obedient Wife in the World, becauſe, ſaith he, ſhe willeth nothing, but what I will: And as all men wondred at it, (knowing her to be the moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient) yea (ſaith he) but I muſt firſt will what ſhe willeth, elſe ſhe wills nothing that I will.</p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:124638:55"/>
                  <p n="11">11. This ſort of Government is unjuſt, and unreaſonable; for not only the Party judgeth its Party, but alſo inſlicteth the ſame puniſhment, viz. <hi>Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> upon all offending Churches, whatever the offence be, great or ſmall, in caſe of non-ſatisfaction; whereas all Puniſhments ſhould be commenſura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto the ſeverall Offences.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. And ſo ye ſeem to approve the Opinion of the Stoicks, who held all ſinnes to be equall; ſince ye inflict the ſame puniſhment upon them all.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. Not only this Diſcipline cannot be eaſily put in execution in great Kingdomes, as <hi>England,</hi> wherein all the Churches offended cannot ſo eaſily meet together: But alſo,</p>
                  <p n="14">14. Becauſe the perſon offended, after he hath repreſented his grievances unto the Church, and that Church hath received ſatisfaction, he may goe to another; and ſo continually, <hi>in infinitum,</hi> to the Worlds end, evermore ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thoſe Churches for the Party, that judge it; which is moſt abſurd and fooliſh.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. What if the Party offended be poore, and have not the meanes to poſt up and down from neigbour-Church to neighbour-Church, to pray them to make the offending Church to give an account of her Iudgement? Much leſſe, to attend upon their uncertain conveniencie? Here will be found true, <hi>Pauper ubique jacet;</hi> Whereas in Presbyteriall Government, the Party offended may be eaſily redreſſed, and get ſatisfaction, as not having need ſo to poſt up and down, to be at ſo great charges, or to attend their conveniencie; for by a ſimple Appeale he may binde the Church offending to appeare at the day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. What if there ſhould fall out an hundred ſuch offences in a ſhort time? Muſt ſo many Churches evermore gather together for every one of them apart?</p>
                  <p n="17">17. What if Churches be poore, and cannot be at ſo great expence? Then in that caſe, it ſhould ſeem, there is no Order to meet with Offences. I may adde theſe following Reaſons:</p>
                  <p n="18">18. This <hi>Independencie</hi> maketh all the Churches of Chriſt like ſo many <hi>Scopae diſſolutae,</hi> looſe Broomes, that have no tye or band to hold them together; and ſo deſtroyeth the unity of the Militant Church.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. The very word <hi>Independencie,</hi> applied to men, how much more the thing ſignified thereby, ſhould be odious to all Chriſtian ears, as being proper to God Almighty. How proud &amp; abominable is this expreſſion; <hi>We ſeven men, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute this Church, we will not depend on all the Churches of this World; We will not depend on any create Eccleſiaſticall power, yea not upon all the Angels in Heaven, and men upon Earth: but will be Independents, and have others to depend upon us?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="20">20. If ſo, what is the cauſe that ye oppoſe the Kings Majeſties Abſolute or Independent power in State matters? Truly, this being only Secular, cannot be ſo dangerous as the other, viz. as Yours; for this only may be prejudiciall
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:124638:55"/>to our Bodies, or States; but Yours may kill millions of Soules: neither is the Kings Authority more limited in the State, then yours is in the Church.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. What? will ye, that where-ever there is 7. or 8. of you combined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to make up a Church, ye ſhall depend on no man, but have an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent and abſolute power to bring into the Kingdome whatever Hereſie ye pleaſe, to blaſpheme God, and ſo, <hi>vi irreſiſtibili,</hi> with the Arminians, to goe to Hell? If ſo, God have mercy on you.</p>
                  <p>But it may be ſaid, that the Civill Magiſtrate may hinder them: But <hi>M.S.</hi> will anſwer, 1. That he ſhould not puniſh any man for Religion. 2. That the Civill Power is of another ſort then Eccleſiaſticall. 3. What if the Civill Magiſtrate be not a <hi>Proteſtant?</hi> or what if he be a profane man? 4. Howbeit he were a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> and a good Chriſtian, yet ſhould it follow, that the Church-power is neither ſufficient, nor perfect, <hi>in ſuo genere;</hi> ſince it muſt have recourſe unto the Civill Magiſtrates power, which is of another nature, and <hi>extra hoc Genus.</hi>

                     <hi>CHAP. III. M.S.</hi> his Evaſions refuted, and my Arguments made good, and firſt, thoſe that he bringeth againſt the third Argument.</head>
                  <p>M.S. anſwereth not all, nor any conſiderable number of my Arguments, as he confeſſeth himſelfe; but ſcratcheth at a few of them, whereby he weakens them not; but overthroweth the Government of all States; That of the Church of the Old Teſtament, the Practice of the Apoſtles, and Apoſtolike Churches, and the fundaments of Independent Government it ſelf, as, God willing, we ſhall ſee hereafter. The firſt of my Reaſons, that he ſnaps at, is the 3. <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Remedy, viz. of <hi>non-Communion,</hi> is not ſufficient, nor ſatisfactory; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all Churches according to your Tenets be equall in authority, Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent one of another, and <hi>par in parem non habet imperium,</hi> none hath power or authority over his equall: How then could any Church binde any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to any ſuch accompt, but out of its freewill, as a party may doe to its party?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>M. S.</hi> 1. Suppoſe that courſe, which the Apologiſts inſiſt upon, be not in the eye of reaſon, a means ſufficient to ſuch a purpoſe, yet if it be a meanes which God hath authorized, for the effecting it, it will do the deed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.S.</hi> It ſeemth that <hi>M.S.</hi> would fain enter into the Liſts againſt Reaſon it ſelf; but he muſt know, that Gods Ordinance, and Reaſon, are not oppoſite one to another; ſince he who is the author of Nature, is the Author of Grace alſo: neither as Author of Nature, ſights he againſt himſelf, as Author of Grace. 2. It is a Maxime of Popery and Lutheraniſme, to oppoſe Nature &amp; Grace. 3. Chriſt and the Apoſtles ſerved themſelves of Naturall Reaſon in Scripture. 4. And out of the caſe of ſupernaturall revelation above it, which cannot be contrary
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:124638:56"/>unto it, it muſt be beleeved. 5 He ſuppoſeth, that Independency, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing and renouncing all Chriſtian Communion with ſuch Churches, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they repent, is a ſufficient meanes, authorized by God, which hitherto ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth not; yea the contrary appeareth by our Reaſons. 6. Yet is it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, that I have reaſon, for me, and he none; yea nothing but his Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent will.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>M. S.</hi> will not make good the Reaſons brought for this Opinion by the Apologiſts, which I have abundantly reſuted, but proveth, as followeth; <hi>That a withdrawing of Chriſtian Communion</hi> from perſons walking inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinately, is an Ordinance, or meanes appointed by God, for the reducing, and reclaiming of them. 2. Theſ. 3.6.14. <hi>We warn you Brethren in the name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that ye withdraw your ſelves from every Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that walketh inordinately,</hi> (<hi>A. S.</hi> I adde the reſt) Verſ. 7. <hi>For we behaved not our ſelves inordinately among you.</hi> Verſ. 8. <hi>Neither did we eate any mans bread for nought, but wrought with labour and travell, night and day, that we might not be chargeable to any of you.</hi> Verſ. 10. <hi>This we commanded you, that if any would not worke, neither ſhould he eate.</hi> Verſ. 11. <hi>For we heare, that there are ſome which walke among you inordinately, working not at all, but are buſie-bodies.</hi> Verſ. 14. <hi>If any man obey not our word by this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be aſhamed.</hi> Verſ. 15. <hi>Yet count him not as an Enemy, but admoniſh him as a Brother.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A. S.</hi> But this proofe, is no better, then that of the Apologiſts; and to Anſwer it, I will not ſerve my ſelfe with the Anſwer, that ſome men bring here, viz. That this Teſtimony of Scripture is not to be taken of the great Excommunication, which onely you ſeeme to acknowledge for Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: nor of the leſſer, which you ſeeme to call <hi>non-Communion,</hi> or with the Apoſtle here, <hi>withdrawing of Chriſtian Communion.</hi> 2. Or that it is a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement onely given to particular perſons, to forbear ſuch perſons, who were idle, and yet buſie-bodies, running from houſe to houſe, living upon other mens charges, under pretext (peradventure) of Piety: But not to the Church, to <hi>excommunicate them;</hi> and that, becauſe the Apoſtle addeth, v. 15. <hi>Yet count him not as an Enemy, but as a Brother:</hi> for this Reaſon is weak: and an Excommunicate perſon, if he be Excommunicated <hi>Excommunicatione minori,</hi> yea and ſometimes <hi>majori,</hi> may be accounted as a Brother, ſo long as there is any hope of his Repentance.</p>
                  <p>I had rather ſay, 1. That here the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of Excommunication; 1. Becauſe he ſayes, <hi>Note him,</hi> i. e. that he may be diſcerned from others. 2. He ſayes, <hi>Have no company,</hi> or meddle not with him. Now what is Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, but to have no Communion or company with a man. 2. I ſay, that he ſpeaketh not of the greater, but of the leſſer Excommunication, 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, that it is not for any great crime, but for an ordinary ſinne, viz. <hi>Idleneſſe.</hi> 2. Becauſe this note of Excommunication, is only, that he may be aſhamed.</p>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:124638:56"/>
                  <p n="3">3. Becauſe he is not to be reputed for an enemy of the Church, but as a Brother. 4. Becauſe the Apoſtle biddeth onely, <hi>Note him,</hi> and admoniſh him: which is leſſe then to be given over to Sathan; yea it is credible, that it was only a private Suſpenſion from the Lords Table, not in publique, in face of the whole Church, but before the particular Presbytery. 3. He ſeemeth not to ſpeake directly of whole Churches, but of particular perſons. 1. Since he ſayes, <hi>From every Brother,</hi> verſ. 6. 2. Becauſe he ſayes, that there are ſome among you that <hi>walke inordinately:</hi> Now the whole Church can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid to be among the Church, or ſome of the Church, but particular perſons only. 3. Becauſe he ſayeth, <hi>If any man obey not, let that man be noted;</hi> but if the whole Church were ſuch, there ſhould be none there to <hi>note</hi> him. 4. <hi>That man</hi> cannot ſignifie <hi>that Church.</hi> 5. Becauſe the Apoſtle, verſ. 15. commandeth to <hi>admoniſh him as a Brother,</hi> but a <hi>Brother</hi> is not a <hi>Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. And nevertheleſſe, howſoever the Apoſtle ſpeakes principally, directly, and formally of the Excommunication of Perſons; yet muſt he conſequently and directly meane alſo the Excommunication of Churches; and that for the Reaſons, that I brought elſe where, viz. in the Obſervations and Annotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon the Apologeticall Narration, page 43. §. 2. 1. For Churches Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences may deſerve it. 2. The Scripture hath nothing to the contrary of Excommunication of Churches. 3 Becauſe there is the ſame reaſon for the Excommunication of whole Churches, as of particular Perſons, viz. The taking away of Scandall, and the converſion of ſinners, 1 Cor. 5.5. 2 Cor. 2.7. 2. Theſ. 3.14. 1 Tim. 1.20. and that ſuch a contagion infect not others, 1 Cor. 5.6, 7. And this reaſon <hi>M. S.</hi> very wiſely borrowed from me in this place, ſaying, <hi>There is the ſame reaſon of Churches in this behalf, which there is of perſons, M. S.</hi> to <hi>A. S.</hi> page 76. Onely this I note here, that if there be the ſame reaſon of Churches. <hi>Ergo,</hi> As a Particular perſon may be Excommunicated <hi>Excommunicatione minori,</hi> by a publike, or a particular ſentence of non-<hi>Communion,</hi> for a leſſer fault; ſo may a whole Church: And conſequently, as a particular perſon may be Excommunicated, <hi>Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catione majori,</hi> for a very great ſin, and wickedneſſe; ſo may a whole parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church, which the Independent Sect will no wayes grant. And this, I pray the Reader to obſerve, and to preſſe it againſt them; for I am aſſured they cannot here eſcape, unleſſe <hi>M. S.</hi> eſcape them. 4. Becauſe 7000. Churches may as well Excommunicate one compounded of ſeventeen Perſons, as that one may Excommunicate ſeven of its Members. 5. Becauſe an Hereticall Church is Excommunicated in Heaven; Wherefore then ſhall ſhe not be Excommunicated by Chriſts Miniſters here upon Earth, when they learn it by Scripture? Muſt not the Churches here upon Earth, concur as well with Gods Sentence in Heaven, as God with theirs here upon Earth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18? 6. Becauſe the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> Excommunicated that of the ten Tribes.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>M. S.</hi> his ſecond Anſwer to this Argument. Suppoſe there were no ſuch ſufficient, or ſatisfactory <hi>remedy</hi> for the <hi>inconveniency</hi> mentioned in the way of the <hi>Apologiſts,</hi> yet <hi>Lawyers</hi> have a ſaying, <hi>That a miſchief is better then an inconveniency,</hi> &amp;c. (and afterwards) Now then much better is it to want a <hi>remedy</hi> againſt ſuch an evill, which poſſibly may not fall out within an age, though it be greater, when it doth fall, then it is to expoſe our ſelves to <hi>continuall droppings,</hi> I mean to thoſe daily <hi>inconveniencies, which we lately ſhewed to be incident to the Claſſique Government.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A. S.</hi> 1. I accept of your Suppoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> That there is no ſufficient, or ſatisfactory remedy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as it appeareth cleerly by my Reaſons. 2. To your Maxime of Law, I grant you willingly, That ye have no remedy againſt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs, but your Churches muſt neceſſarily ſuffer them, and are expoſed to them: Praiſed be God, that Presbyterians ſerve themſelves with no miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous, but with very holy Remedies. 3. I deny, that it is better to want a Remedy againſt ſuch a miſchief: <hi>viz.</hi> If a Church Apoſtatize, become Hereticall, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then to accept of the Presbyterian Remedy againſt ſuch miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, or of the miſchief it ſelf; for we muſt never in any Caſe accept of <hi>malum culpae,</hi> ſuch as is the acceptation of Apoſtaſie or Hereſie in a whole Church. 4. Neither is there any, nor have you yet ſhewn any Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency in the Presbyteriall way: But we have ſhewn many, as Reall in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent way, as thoſe are imaginary that you attribute to the Presbyterian way. 5. All the Inconveniency that this man pretends to be in the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian way, is, Dependency of particular Congregations upon Superiour Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, <hi>viz.</hi> Claſſes, Synods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or Subordination amongſt Eccleſiaſticall Iudicatories; for this Sect muſt be altogether Independent, and every one in their Churches ſupreme Eccleſiaſticall Judges, and their Churches ſupreme Eccleſiaſticall Iudicatories, be they never ſo Hereticall or prophane: But this Inconveniency may be preſſed home again, 1. For there is Subordination among their particular Congregations, and their Synods; onely they hate the Authority of Synods. 2. There was a Subordination of Authority in the Old Teſtament. 3. So is there in Civill Government; And whatſoever In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniency they preſſe againſt us, it will hold in all the reſt, as we ſhall ſee hereafter, God willing. 4. If ſuch a Dependency, or Subordination be any Inconveniency, then God is the cauſe of it, as we have heretofore fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>M. S.</hi> Delinquency of whole Churches is not an every dayes Caſe, no more in the way of <hi>Congregationall,</hi> then of <hi>Presbyteriall Government.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A. S.</hi> 1. It may be as ordinary a Caſe in the <hi>Church,</hi> as that of Inferiour Iudicatories in the State. 2. And it fell out amongſt the Arminians, and us; 3. So did it amongſt your <hi>Churches</hi> in <hi>Holland;</hi> 4. So doth it betwixt you and us, ſince ye are become Sectaries; 5. So doth it among all <hi>Churches,</hi> that become Hereticall, or Schiſmaticall, and the <hi>Orthodox Church;</hi> and the Apoſtle tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:124638:57"/>us, that there muſt be Hereſies, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.19. So it is not ſo extraordinary a Caſe, as you <hi>M. S.</hi> make it. And therefore, there muſt be an <hi>Eccleſiaſticall Ordinance</hi> for it, as well in the Church, as in the State; 1. Unleſſe you ſay, That God is more provident for the <hi>State,</hi> then for the <hi>Church;</hi> or more negligent in his care of the <hi>Church,</hi> then of the <hi>State.</hi> 2. There was a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy for ſuch Caſes in the Old Teſtament, as I ſhewed you in my <hi>Annotations;</hi> wherefore not alſo in the New Teſtament? 3. Howbeit, it be not an every dayes Caſe, yet the Independents have a <hi>remedy</hi> for it; <hi>viz.</hi> The Sentence of non-Communion, whereof I may ſay as much, as he ſayes of Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; for the <hi>Independent Churches</hi> could not pronounce ſuch a Sentence, unleſſe they had, or pretended to have an Authoritative power to do it; for it belongeth to the power of the Keyes. 4. It is, or may be more ordinary amongſt the <hi>Independent Churches,</hi> then among ours. 1. Becauſe of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency, and want of Superiour Eccleſiaſticall power, to keep them in order: 2. Becauſe they tye the Members of their <hi>Churches,</hi> never to quit them, without the <hi>Churches</hi> conſent, whereof they are Members, which may breed quarrels betwixt two-<hi>Churches,</hi> if a Member of the one, without her conſent, joyn himſelf to the other. 3. And this may be confirmed by the Examples of thoſe moſt bitter quarrels betwixt two of your Churches, and their Paſtors in <hi>Holland,</hi> as it is related by Maſter <hi>Edwards</hi> in his <hi>Antapologia:</hi> but according to ordinary Providence, no ſuch thing can fall out among our Churches; and if it ſhould fall out, we have a preſent remedy, <hi>viz.</hi> a Claſſe, which may be gathered within the ſpace of four or five dayes: if that do not the buſineſſe, we may gather a Synod or a Superiour power, which cannot Morally be contemned among us by any Inferiour power, as the equall power of Independent Churches may by their equall.</p>
                  <p>If it fall out extraordinarily amongſt us, we have an ordinary remedy for ſuch an extraordinary Caſe.</p>
                  <p>And howbeit, it were extraordinary, and very rare; yet ſhould there be a remedy provided for it, ſo ſoon as once it falleth out, for it is a Caſe, that bringeth a very great miſchief with it, <hi>viz.</hi> The revoult of a Church or many Churches, that is an inconvenience, yea, a miſchief a thouſand times worſe, howbeit, it ſhould fall out but once in an Age, then all the <hi>droppings</hi> of Maſter <hi>Goodwin,</hi> or all the <hi>inconveniencies,</hi> that can be alleadged againſt a conſtant <hi>remedy,</hi> were they as reall, as they are fictitious and imaginary.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>M. S.</hi> anſwereth my firſt Argument: They that implead the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregationall way, for being defective; ſuppoſe, that God hath put a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of power into the hands of men, to <hi>remedy</hi> all poſſible defects, errours, and miſcarriages of men whatſoever. But that is untrue. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A. S.</hi> I anſwer; They ſuppoſe not, that God hath put into their hands a ſufficiency of power to remedy all defects and miſcarriages whatſoever; or all poſſible abſolutely, but <hi>ex ſuppoſitione finis obtinendi, i. e.</hi> that may conduce
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:124638:58"/>to obtain the end, that God hath commanded us to intend, and to tend unto; for ſince his will is, that ſpirituall diſeaſes be cured, it muſt conſequently be, to give the <hi>remedies</hi> neceſſary or ſufficient to obtain ſuch an end or cure. 2. I ſuppoſe not that God hath given us all means ſufficient <hi>Phyſicè,</hi> but <hi>moraliter, i. e.</hi> that are morally ſufficient, and whereby morally we may be convicted of ſin, if we uſe them not; as cured of our ill, if we uſe them. 3. I ſuppoſe, that they muſt be ſufficient according to Gods ordinary providence, whereby he governeth ordinarily his Church, and not abſolutely. 4. As ſufficient, as in the <hi>Civill State,</hi> or as in the Old Teſtament at leaſt; ſince the Government in the New Teſtament, is as perfect, as in the Old; and not ſimply or abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely. And ſo the Aſſumption is falſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>M. S.</hi> proveth, that this <hi>inconveniency</hi> preſſeth as well the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> as the <hi>Independents.</hi> If your Supreme <hi>Seſſion</hi> of <hi>Presbyteries</hi> ſhould miſcarry (ſaith he) and give us Hay, Stubble, and Wood, inſtead of Silver and Gold, what remedy?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A. S.</hi> This is a very extraordinary <hi>Caſe,</hi> yea, the moſt extraordinary that can be imagined, <hi>viz.</hi> That all the <hi>Churches,</hi> both in Superiour and Inferiour Judicatories ſhould ſo miſcarry; and yet if a man have uſed all poſſible means, and this miſcarry alſo, which is more then any ordinary <hi>Caſe,</hi> we may ſay, 1. that we have had all means that are morally poſſible, and that no more can morally be deſired. 2. We have had all the means, and if we ſerved our ſelves of them all, till we came to this extraordinary <hi>Caſe,</hi> we are excuſable. 3. We have had all the means poſſible, according to Gods ordinary Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. 4. All means, that they had in the Old Teſtament, or that they have in the State. 5. I anſwer, that this Suppoſition may as well be propounded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Gods Providence in the Government of the State, and of the <hi>Church</hi> of the Old Teſtament, as againſt that of the New. Now anſwer me, What if the great <hi>Sanedrim</hi> had miſcarried in the Old Teſtament, as ſome times it did; or the <hi>Parliament</hi> and the <hi>Kings Counſell</hi> in the <hi>State;</hi> what ſhould be be done in ſuch a <hi>Caſe?</hi> And then I ſhall anſwer you the other. It is a foolery to diſpute againſt Gods Ordinance. 6. I anſwer, That in ſuch an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary <hi>Caſe,</hi> which goeth beyond all particular <hi>Laws,</hi> and <hi>Orders</hi> eſtabliſhed in the Church, <hi>viz.</hi> When all the ordinary <hi>Seers</hi> become blinde, or miſlead the Flock, there being no ordinary, we muſt have recourſe to ſuch extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary <hi>remedies,</hi> as are moſt convenient, or at leaſt not repugnant to Gods Word, and attend upon Gods extraordinary Providence. The Provinciall <hi>Synods</hi> may refuſe to put in execution the Acts of the Generall Aſſembly; ſo may particular <hi>Churches,</hi> for they are not bound to be Actors for the generall Aſſembly, in any thing againſt Gods Word. 7. But what if in your petty <hi>Congregations</hi> of ſeven or eight perſons, four perſons, or perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture all the <hi>Congregation</hi> miſcarry? What ſhall be done? You will happily ſay; 1. Seck <hi>Counſell:</hi> But if all the <hi>Congregation</hi> be corrupted, none of them will ask <hi>counſell,</hi> but they will all rather lurk, and hide their Tenets,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:124638:58"/>as the <hi>Independents</hi> do here at the <hi>Synod:</hi> If you ſay again, Other <hi>Churches</hi> that are offended, may complain to <hi>Neighbour Churches:</hi> But what if they know not their Tenets? What if the <hi>Delinquent Church</hi> will not own them, but Ieſuitically elude all Interrogatories, as the <hi>Antinomians,</hi> the <hi>Independents,</hi> and all other <hi>Sectaries</hi> do here? What if they own them? What can the <hi>Churches</hi> offended do; for <hi>M. S.</hi> will tell you, they cannot be Iudge, ſince they are Parties; or if they judge, they can but judge, as ſo many Lackeys or Foot-Boyes: They have no more Authority to command that <hi>Delinquent Church,</hi> then that <hi>Delinquent Church</hi> hath to command them all.</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>But they will pronounce a Sentence of non-Communion againſt Her.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> So will ſhe againſt them; and what then? What remedy for all this diſorder, that is not taken away by all this, but ſtill increaſeth? It may be yet ſaid, they may go to the <hi>Civill Magiſtrate. A. S.</hi> But that is no <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall</hi> remedy; and <hi>M. S.</hi> will tell you, 1. as well as I have done, that ſo the laſt reſolution of <hi>Eccleſiaſticall</hi> and <hi>Spirituall Judgements</hi> ſhould be in the ſecular power, which he holds impoſſible. 2. Yea, in the power of a Pagan or Antichriſtian Chriſtian. 3. And I muſt ſay, That things are never reſolved, but into their own Principles, and ſuch is not <hi>Politicall Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> in reſpect of <hi>Eccleſiaſticall.</hi> 4. So you have not entireneſſe of juriſdiction, as <hi>M. S.</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Independents</hi> pretend in his firſt Reaſon. 5. So you are put to trouble and charges, which is againſt your other Reaſon: So 6. you are ſubject to Strangers, which deſtroyeth your other Reaſon; for you hold for Strangers, all ſuch, as be not of your particular <hi>Congregations,</hi> as your Reaſons hereafter following, fully declare. 7. You are not ruled with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in your ſelves, which deſtroyes your other Reaſon: So 8. you ſhall not be judged by your own Paſtour, which is another of your Reaſons. 9. You ſhall be judged by one, who appearingly cannot fall in the ſame Caſe, and ſo it deſtroyes your other Reaſon. 10. The party being tender Foreheaded, might be changed into a ſtone before <hi>Meduſa</hi>'s Head, as you ſay, in preſence of ſtrange Faces, and of his Betters, which deſtroyeth again another of your Reaſons. I might bring many more Inconveniences againſt him, which he bringeth againſt us, as deſtructory to the ſweet Liberties and Priviledges of the <hi>Church;</hi> But I muſt be ſhort: Onely I adde, that to ſpeak <hi>morè humano;</hi> it is not credible, That all Inferiour Iudicatories, will or dare, be ſo impudent, as to miſcarry in any thing, ſo manifeſtly contrary to the common Tenets or Practiſes of the whole <hi>Nationall Church,</hi> for the Inferiour Iudicatories will evermore fear, in caſe of their unjuſt Iudgement, to be condemned and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured in the Superiour; and the Supreme it ſelf may fear, That if they judge any thing amiſſe, their Iudgements will not be approved, and put in executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Particular Churches; and in all humane probability they are like to be croſſed.</p>

                  <p>VVHereas in my ninth Reaſon, I ſhew, That the <hi>Presbyteriall Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is ſubject to none of theſe Inconveniences,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A. S.</hi> I willingly accept of this your confeſſion.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A. S.</hi> So it is a doubt in <hi>M. S.</hi> his conceit, Whether it be not much better to tolerate, yea, to admit, and permit, a thouſand Hereſies, and Blaſphemies, and to let whole Churches go to Hell, then to ſubmit to <hi>Presbyteriall Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> ſuch as we have defined it. 1. To let a Church be Hereticall, then to be reduced to <hi>Chriſt</hi> by any Eccleſiaſticall power, meerly Spirituall and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteriall, or any other, ſuch as was in the Old Teſtament, or as is in the State.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>M. S.</hi> What if your <hi>combined Elderſhip,</hi> hath neither footing, or foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Word of God?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A. S.</hi> What if it have foot and foundation on the Word of God? What if we have proved it already? What if it had no foot in Gods Word, but were no way repugnant unto it? Yet were it not in ſuch a caſe to be rejected, but by a thouſand fold to be preferred before Independency, whereupon fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſo many abominable abſurdities, ſo repugnant to Gods Word, yea unto Naturall Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>M. S.</hi> It is not the ſerviceableneſſe of it, againſt a thouſand ſuch <hi>inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies,</hi> as were mentioned, that will juſtifie it, <hi>and this he proveth by the examples of</hi> Sauls <hi>offering Sacrifice,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.9, 13, 14. Of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah</hi> in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth his hand to the Ark. <hi>Peters</hi> zeal in drawing his ſword; And addeth,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:124638:59"/>That the Popes abſolute Authority, is as Soveraign a Remedy againſt all theſe Inconveniencies as Claſſique Authority.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A. S.</hi> 1. I argued not from meer <hi>inconveniences,</hi> but from <hi>conveniences;</hi> and the want of <hi>inconveniences,</hi> and <hi>repugnancy</hi> to Gods Word to juſtifie our Government, and from <hi>inconveniences</hi> to refuſe yours; Neither can a Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <hi>Theſis,</hi> be otherwayes proved, but by a <hi>Medium,</hi> that is repugnant either to the Attribute, or to the Subject of the Queſtion. So this your <hi>Cenſure</hi> is very ridiculous, abſurd, and impertinent. 2. I have proved it to be conform to Gods Word. 3. It is not credible, but that Government is moſt conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to Gods Word, which is moſt convenient, and commenſurate unto the end, That God commands us to intend, and to tend into; neither can I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, that God hath ordained us any means, that are not fit and proper for the end, that he intends, or commands us to intend; for that were <hi>repugnant</hi> to his Soveraign Wiſedom. 4. And as for your Examples, they are not to the purpoſe; for all theſe facts of <hi>Saul, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah, &amp;c.</hi> were contrary to Gods expreſſe command; neither were they convenient to the end intended by God, or that we ſhould tend unto, <hi>viz.</hi> Filiall Obedience to the command, and the Typifying of Chriſt, and his Benefits. The example of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> was, 1. a manifeſt breach of the ſixth Commandment, in killing a man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out publike Authority. 2. It implyed an act of diffidence, and of too great confidence; as if Chriſt had had no other means to deliver himſelf, but his ſword; in this <hi>Peter</hi> truſted too much to his own ſword, and too little to Gods Providence. 3. It contained an act of Precipitation, and too great boldneſſe, and raſhneſſe, in drawing his ſword in his Maſters preſence, without, yea, againſt his Maſters will and command. 4. It was repugnant to the end, for which Chriſt came into the Word, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſts death, and the Redemption of mankinde by it, whereof <hi>Peter</hi> before that time had been ſo oft advertiſed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So is it not in <hi>Presbyteriall Diſcipline:</hi> Neither is there any damnable Errour or Hereſie in <hi>Conſiſtoriall Government,</hi> as in the <hi>Papacy:</hi> We ſay not that any of our Aſſemblies are Infallible, as the Pope pretends himſelf and his Generall Councell to be; neither pretend we, That our Aſſemblies have any deſpoticall or lordly domination over the Church, as the Pope doth; we ſay not, That our Aſſemblies are above Gods Word, as they do. Theſe compariſons of <hi>M. S.</hi> are no leſſe then blaſphemous.</p>
                  <p>And here I muſt advertiſe the Reader, That all the Presbyteriall Aſſemblies together, take no greater Authority over the Church, then ſix or ſeven In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent Tinkers, an Hangman with them, together with one of their Miniſters, do over the flock: The Independent Preacher with his ſix or ſeven perſons, are liker to the Pope, and the Conſiſtory of his Cardinalls, becauſe of their Independency, then any of our Churches, which are all Dependents, and ſubject to Superiour Authority.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>M. S. pag.</hi> 79. §. in his ſecond Anſwer, telleth me, That he cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:124638:60"/>himſelf, 1. What <hi>A. S.</hi> means by Authoritative power. 2. Or from whence our Churches have it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A. S.</hi> I have 1, fully declared in my <hi>Annotations,</hi> and here above, what it is. 2. And from whence it proceedeth.</p>
                  <p>It is a Miniſteriall power to command ſuch as are ſubject thereunto, which bindeth, or obligeth them to obedience, and whereby, in caſe of diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, they may inflict Spirituall puniſhments. It is of God, or from God; and therefore lawfull; Now whether it be of God, as <hi>Author of Nature, or of Grace,</hi> by the Law of Nature, or any Poſitive Law, Naturall, or Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall; it is not a Queſtion <hi>de re: ſed de modo rei,</hi> not of the thing it ſelf, but of the manner thereof. Grant me, either that it is lawfull, or deny it; If it be a lawfull power, it is of God, for there is no lawfull power, but of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.2. Grant me the thing, and afterwards I ſhall diſpute with you, <hi>de modo rei.</hi> They have it not of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> nor of the <hi>State,</hi> as you pretend; for ſecular men cannot give any Spirituall power into the Church; they have it of God, and by Gods Word, <hi>directè,</hi> or <hi>per conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam;</hi> and in ſome things, <hi>per non repugnantiam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is an untruth in <hi>M. S.</hi> in his third Anſwer, whereas he ſayeth, that I ſeem to imply, That the Church hath this power from the Law of the <hi>State;</hi> for howbeit, the Civill Magiſtrate, by his Laws put a Politicall Obligation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſtians, to obey the Churches Spirituall Authority, which is from God; yet is not his Civill Authority the cauſe of the Churches Spirituall Authority, or of the Obligation, whereby a Chriſtian is bound to obey the Church; for howbeit, there were no Civill Magiſtrate; or howbeit, he ſhould diſſent from ſuch an Obedience, yet ſhould the Church have Spirituall power; and all the Members of the Church in a Spirituall way ſhould be bound to Obedience: But what then doth the Civill Magiſtrates Law? <hi>Anſw.</hi> It puts a new Bond or Obligation upon the Members of the Church, and bindes them again, by a Civill Authority, Extrinſecall to the Church, to a Spirituall Obedience, who heretofore were onely bound by a Spirituall Obligation; ſo he bindes them to a Spirituall Obedience, but not ſpiritually, as the Church Authority doth, but onely materially, and that by Civill Authority: So the Miniſters of the Goſpel, (or rather God by them) oblige and binde the Subjects in the <hi>State,</hi> in a Spirituall way, by Gods Word, to obey the Civill Magiſtrate, or Politicall and Civill Obedience, but not <hi>Politically,</hi> or <hi>Civilly;</hi> but <hi>Spiritually:</hi> ſo it followeth not, That the Civill Magiſtrate hath power to form Eccleſiaſticall Government: onely it followeth, That in a Politicall way, he may oblige, or binde men to obey it. No more followeth it, that I reſolve Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into the humors, wills, and pleaſures of the World, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Onely it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, That the Civill Obligation, laid upon men, to obey the Church, ſo far forth as Civill, muſt be finally reſolved into the Civill Magiſtrates power, and not into his humours, as <hi>M. S.</hi> moſt contemptuouſly ſpeaketh of him.</p>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:124638:60"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>M. S.</hi> his fourth Anſwer is in retorting my Arguments. 1. What if a <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Congregation,</hi> under the juriſdiction of your <hi>Elderſhip,</hi> reflecting upon the <hi>Oath</hi> or <hi>Covenant</hi> it hath taken for ſubjection thereunto, as likewiſe upon all other ingagements that way, as unlawfull, ſhall peremptorily refuſe to ſtand to the awards or determinations of it, what will you do in this Caſe? Will you Excommunicate this <hi>Church?</hi> The Apologiſts, in their way do little leſſe; or will you deliver them, <hi>brachio ſeculari?</hi> To be hampered, and taught better then it ſeemeth you can teach them by Priſons, Fines, Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>&amp;c. Churches had need take heed how they chuſe men for their guardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> that will ſo diſpoſe of them, if they pleaſe them not.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And what if in the <hi>Seſſion</hi> of your <hi>combined Elderſhip,</hi> there be no ſuch thing as Pluralitie of Votes, concerning the Excommunication of ſuch a <hi>Church?</hi> Is not the <hi>remedy</hi> you ſpeak of now in the duſt?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A. S.</hi> To the firſt Quaere, I anſwer, That we muſt do by Spirituall power in the <hi>Church,</hi> that, that the <hi>Civill Magiſtrate</hi> doth by the ſecular power in the <hi>State,</hi> in ſuch a Caſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Miniſters in the New Teſtament muſt proceed ſpiritually againſt all Delinquent, and Impenitent perſons; as the Miniſters in the Old Teſtament did againſt theirs, according to Gods Word, unleſſe ſuch a proceeding be abrogated in the New Teſtament.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They muſt do as <hi>M. S.</hi> hath taught us, as they do againſt particular perſons, in commenſurating the puniſhments to the ſins. <hi>i. e.</hi> They muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed by particular Admonitions, and Cenſures againſt leſſer ſins in private, or before the <hi>Presbytery;</hi> by ſuſpenſion from the Lords Table, againſt greater ſins; by publike ſuſpenſion or leſſer Excommunication, againſt greater ſins; and by the great Excommunication, againſt the greateſt ſins.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>M. S.</hi> confeſſeth, That the Apologiſts in their way do little leſſe.</p>

                     <hi>A. S.</hi> If ſo, then they do a little worſe then the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and ſo they quit a little <hi>M. S.</hi> his own rule, whereby he willeth them to proceed, as againſt particular Perſons.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. If all this ſuffice not, it is the <hi>Civill Magiſtrates</hi> part to proceed againſt them, as Troublers of the Peace of the <hi>Church,</hi> and conſequently of the <hi>Chriſtian State,</hi> and not to permit them to erect a new Sect, as it is ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly practiſed amongſt the Independents of <hi>New England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. They muſt be puniſhed for their Perjury, and for the breach of their <hi>Covenant;</hi> but none of thoſe puniſhments can be inflicted, but after ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent conviction, at leaſt Morally, <hi>in foro externo:</hi> And ſuch puniſhments are the fitteſt for them, after ſuch a conviction, when they pertinaciouſly reſiſt the Spirit of God; for ſuch men fear more the Gibbet, then Hell-fire. What you ſay of your ſecond Chapter, it is ſufficiently anſwered; What you ſay of <hi>Churches, That they had need to take heed, how they chuſe men for their Guardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> &amp;c. If by thoſe Guardians you mean the <hi>Civill Magiſtrate,</hi> it is not

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. What if it be ſo in your Aſſemblies or Synods? 2. If it be any inferior Eccleſiaſticall Iudicatory, they muſt remit it to a ſuperior, ever till they come to ſome, wherein the Votes may preponderate: And if in the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Iudicatory, viz. in a Nationall Aſſembly, the Votes preponderate not concerning the Excommunication of ſuch a Church, (which is very extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary) ſhe cannot be excommunicated; and yet if her opinion, or ſin be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, the combined Elderſhip may inflict ſome leſſer Spirituall puniſhment; and if ſuch a Church continue ſtill pertinacious, the Civill Magiſtrate may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed againſt her in a Civill way, as we have ſaid. Neither is this a compliance with <hi>Papiſts, in quality of Papiſts,</hi> but in ſo far forth as they agree with Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; 1. For ſo proceeded the Church of the Old Teſtament; 2. So procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Church of the New Teſtament, in the times of good <hi>Emperours,</hi> as under <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> &amp;c. 3. So proceed they at <hi>Geneva.</hi> 4. So in the <hi>Netherlands.</hi> 5. So the <hi>Independents</hi> of <hi>New-England.</hi> 6. So ſhould M.S. rather doe, then to tolerate open Blaſphemers of the bleſſed Name of God. 7. Dareſt thou, <hi>M. S.</hi> ſo openly plead in favour of Paganiſme of all ſorts of Hereſies, and miſchiefs, and for all ſort of impunitie for them all?, 8. The Truth falleth not to the duſt in ſuch a caſe, but ſinne is puniſhed, but not in ſuch a degree as it ſhould be.</p>
                  <p>To the ſecond Inconveniency that I object againſt the Independents, §. 4. viz. That the <hi>Independent Churches</hi> offended, if they judge the <hi>offending Church,</hi> they ſhould be both <hi>Judge</hi> and <hi>Party.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>M. S.</hi> replieth, p. 80. §. 3. When your <hi>combined Elderſhip</hi> proceedeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a particular Church amongſt you, upon offence taken, is not this <hi>Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> as well <hi>Party,</hi> as <hi>Judge?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.S.</hi> My Argument implieth the Solution of this Objection, viz. That the <hi>combined Elderſhip</hi> cannot be Party, in ſuch a cauſe, becauſe it hath an <hi>Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative power</hi> over the particular Church, (howbeit Spirituall and Miniſteriall) as the <hi>Parliament</hi> over particular Judicatories in the Kingdome: but Parties look one to another as <hi>par parem,</hi> and not as <hi>ſuperior inferiorem.</hi> 2. Neither can any man, or Conſociation take his ordinary Judge to Party, unleſſe he have ſome particular Exceptions againſt him. 3. I propound you the ſame Queſtion concerning the particular Tribes, and the Synagogicall Judicatories amongſt the people of God in the Old Teſtament, when the great <hi>Sanedrim</hi> took of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence at them, or at their Iudgements; whether the great Sanedrim was not both Iudge and Party? Or rather, whether under the notion of Offence ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, it was not to be conſidered as a Party, and under the notion of Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative power, as a Iudge? 4. I propound it of the State, whether the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> may not be conſidered as <hi>Party,</hi> being offended at any <hi>particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation,</hi>
                     <pb n="111" facs="tcp:124638:61"/>and as <hi>Judge,</hi> in quality of the <hi>Repreſentative Body</hi> of the whole <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:</hi> or if it be evermore needfull, that ſome particular Perſon or Perſons compeare in quality of Party againſt particular Conſociations or Townes. 5. In your particular Congregations, may not your Church, under divers noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, be conſidered as Judge and Party? or may every Delinquent take your whole <hi>Presbytery</hi> or <hi>Congregation</hi> to Party. 6. Did not the Arminians ſerve themſelves of this Independent Argument, againſt the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the Synods power? and were not both they, and this their Argument condemned by the judgement of the Synod, as very abſurd and unapt? 7. This Argument concludeth againſt all the ſuperior Powers of this World.</p>
                  <p>Again, <hi>M.S.</hi> 1. telleth us, that this Authoritative power of combined Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries over Congregations is not from above. <hi>A. S.</hi> But we have proved it to be from above, and from God, as <hi>Author</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> and of <hi>Grace.</hi> See the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion concerning the <hi>Subordination of Eccleſiaſticall Judicatories.</hi> 2. <hi>Core, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> objected no leſſe againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron:</hi> yea, as much may be objected againſt God himſelfe, who is Iudge and Party; and Ieſus Chriſt, who is Party, and yet ſhall judge the quick and the dead: For if Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals may ſo eſcape, they will not faile to take their Iudges evermore for Party.</p>
                  <p>M. S. To hold, that all thoſe that have an <hi>Authoritative Power</hi> over men, may lawfully, in vertue of ſuch a Power, be both Iudges and Parties, is to exalt all manner of Tyranny, &amp;c. by Law: for ſo in Church, and State, men inveſted with ſuch a power, may be their own carvers, and ſerve themſelves of the eſtates, liberties and lives of thoſe that are under them, how, and when, and as oft as they liſt: <hi>Adde, But the Conſequence is falſe,</hi> Ergo, <hi>ſo is the Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.S.</hi> I deny the Conſequence; for they have not an abſolute, but a limited power, according to Law, and not to their own particular, but publike will, or in quality of publike perſons, whoſe wills are declared in, or reſtrained ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Law. Neither commandeth <hi>Carolus</hi> the Kingdome, <hi>qua Carolus,</hi> but <hi>qua Rex,</hi> or <hi>qua Carolus Rex, &amp; Lex viva:</hi> and under this notion, he is not his own carver, but the Law carveth for him, and us both; neither can he ſerve himſelfe of other mens Eſtates, &amp;c. but in ſo far as the Law permitteth him: But how much the Law permitteth him, it is not for every particular perſon, nor for every particular and inferior Iudicatory to define it; for Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors, <hi>qua tales,</hi> cannot judge their Superiors, at leaſt ordinarily; and in ſuch a caſe, they remaine no more Inferiors, but become Superiors.</p>
                  <p>To the 3. Inconveniencie, which I note, §. 9. <hi>M.S.</hi> retorteth it in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: Tell me plainly and diſtinctly, what Power more your Government giveth <hi>to a thouſand Churches over one, then to a Tinker, or the Hangman over a thouſand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.S. Anſw.</hi> When they are repreſented in a Repreſentative Church, they
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:124638:62"/>have a ſpirituall Authoritative power over all the Churches that they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, both <hi>Collectivè,</hi> and every one of them <hi>Diſtributivè;</hi> which no Tinker or Hangman hath, either over many, or any one of them; for they have no Authoritative power at all. But amongſt the Independents, a thouſand Churches, whether they be taken <hi>Diſtributivè,</hi> or <hi>Collectivè,</hi> repreſenting all their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Congregations, have no Authoritative power at all; and conſequently, no more then a Tinker or a Hangman.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>M.S.</hi> What makes you think, that the Government of the Apologiſts <hi>gives no more power to a thouſand Churches over one, then to a Tinker or Hangman o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a thouſand? <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi, quando, quibus teſtibus,</hi> did this Government, or any Son it hath, ever make any ſuch compariſon?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.S.</hi> 1. I ſay not that you make any ſuch compariſon, but only I deduce it out of your Tenets by neceſſary conſequence. 2. Neither doe you deny my conſequence, you grant it freely, and tell me, that it is no diſparagement for a thouſand Churches, that a <hi>Tinker,</hi> or a <hi>Hangman</hi> have as much <hi>Authoritative power</hi> over them all, as they have all over any particular Church. And to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme it, you bring me no Reaſon, nor Scripture, but two Teſtimonies; the firſt of <hi>Charron;</hi> who ſaith, <hi>That every Humane Propoſition hath equall autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, if Reaſon make not the difference:</hi> To which I anſwer, 1. That this is but an Humane Authority; 2. Of a Papiſt; 3. And, as many in <hi>France</hi> think, of an Atheiſt; 4. And yet it may be granted in this ſenſe, viz. That it hath as much Naturall, but not ſo much Morall authority: for theſe be Maximes in Nature, and in Reaſon; <hi>Magis credendum pluribus quàm paucioribus, teſtimonio publico quàm privato, ſapientibus quam inſipientibus, peritis quam imperitis, videntibus quàm audientibus: Plus valet oculatus teſtis unus, quàm auriti decem.</hi> 5. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that every <hi>Humane Propoſition</hi> hath <hi>equall authority</hi> according to the <hi>ſpecies</hi> of its <hi>authority,</hi> but not according to the <hi>degrees</hi> thereof; as all <hi>white colours</hi> are equally <hi>white</hi> according to their <hi>ſpecies,</hi> (ſince the definition of <hi>white</hi> belongeth equally to them all; unleſſe you ſay, that <hi>Album eſt genus analogum reſpectu hujus &amp; iſtius, magis &amp; minus albi:</hi> which no true Philoſopher, to my knowledge, ever granted:) But not according to the <hi>graduall latitude of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> conteined within the <hi>species</hi> of <hi>Whiteneſſe.</hi> 6. And here I ask of <hi>M.S.</hi> whether he thinketh that a <hi>Propoſition</hi> of <hi>Indas,</hi> and of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> or <hi>Adam</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his fall, be all of equall authority? Item, Whether a Propoſition of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> before his fall, and after his fall, be of equall authority? Item, Whether a Propoſition of Chriſt, <hi>qua homo,</hi> or as proceeding from his Humane Nature, be of no more authority, then that which proceeds from <hi>Simon</hi> the Magician. If I had leaſure here to diſpute about the foundation of <hi>Authority,</hi> I might ſhew many abſurdities and impertinencies in this Propoſition, in <hi>M. S.</hi> his ſenſe; but I muſt be briefe. The ſecond Authority is of <hi>Gerſon,</hi> and is this: <hi>The ſaying of a ſimple man, and no wayes authorized, if he be well ſeen in the Scriptures, is rather to be believed then the Popes own determination.</hi> But this Propoſition is
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:124638:62"/>not againſt me; for a man well ſeen in Scriptures, <hi>qua talis,</hi> ſpeaketh accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Gods Word, and is ſome wayes authorized by it; but the Popes De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination without Gods Word, is meerly Humane, yea, ordinarily paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>M. S.</hi> confeſſeth ingenuouſly, that I propound many more <hi>Inconveniencies</hi> againſt <hi>Independencie;</hi> but out of modeſty, he will not anſwer them; Only here I note, that <hi>M.S.</hi> in all this his Diſcourſe, anſwereth very little to my Arguments, and objecteth rather againſt our Doctrine, then juſtifieth his own: And to elude my Arguments, pretends evermore ignorance of things that are moſt eaſie, and obvious to all men, which nevertheleſſe I expound moſt cleerly: ſometimes he contemneth them, as unworthy of any Solution; which is a very odde, and new Independent way, <hi>a la mode.</hi>

                     <hi>CHAP. V. M. S.</hi> his firſt two Reaſons for Independency, with the Solutions thereof.</head>
                  <p>M. <hi>S.</hi> with other Independents, prove their Independent Government of every particular Congregation, by ſome frivilous Reaſons. The firſt is this: If a ſingle Congregation being ſolitary, and without Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, hath entireneſſe of Juriſdiction. <hi>Ergo,</hi> every ſingle Congregation hath it. But the firſt is true, according to the Presbyterians Confeſſion. <hi>Ergo,</hi> ſo muſt the ſecond be alſo.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A. S.</hi> I deny the firſt Propoſition, or rather diſtinguiſh it in this manner. If a ſingle Congregation have entireneſſe of Iuriſdiction <hi>abſolutely,</hi> it is true; but then the Aſſumption, or ſecond <hi>Propoſition</hi> is falſe. If a ſingle Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation have it <hi>ſecundum quid,</hi> viz. In caſe of Solitarineſſe, as it is expreſſed in the firſt <hi>Propoſition,</hi> or in caſe of any other neceſſity, that hindereth its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation with Neighbour Churches, as diſtance of place, perſecution, &amp;c. then all other particular Churches muſt have it, in the ſame caſe; it is true: But I deny that ſuch is the caſe of all ſingle Congregations, for they are not all remote from all Neighbourhood of other Churches; nor are they all hindered by perſecution, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>M. S.</hi> But when a ſolitary Congregation hath an entire <hi>Juriſdiction,</hi> then certainly it hath a lawfull right, title, or claime to it. <hi>Ergo,</hi> She hath it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermore.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.S.</hi> 1. She hath a lawfull right by a generall Law of neceſſity, whereby it is ordained, that when we have not all the beſt helps that are neceſſity to do the beſt, we are then to ſerve our ſelves with the beſt we can, and ſuch as we have at hand to ſerve God by: So if we have not Wine to celebrate the Lords Supper with, we may celebrate it with ſome other liquour moſt uſuall for drinke; and there is an Article in the <hi>French</hi> Diſcipline, whereby it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to any man, that cannot drinke wine, to communicate in participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:124638:63"/>only of the Bread: So if men be caſt upon any Iſland, very remote from the Continent, and have none amongſt them endowed with ſufficient abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to preach, or teach them, they may chuſe the ableſt (howbeit he be not abſolutely able enough) to preach, rather then to live without Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances altogether: So <hi>David,</hi> wanting Bread, did eate of the <hi>Shew-bread;</hi> and a man, in caſe of neceſſity, may take other mens meate, and eate it, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then ſtarve. 2. I diſtinguiſh the Conſequent: ſhe hath it evermore, in ſuch a cauſe, <hi>i. e.</hi> in caſe of neceſſity, when ſhe can have no help of Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Churches. I grant it all, otherwayes I deny it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>M. S.</hi> deſireth to know, by what right Neighbour <hi>Churches,</hi> by their preſence, can take ſuch a right from her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A. S.</hi> Neighbour <hi>Churches</hi> by their preſence take no right from her, but by their Neighbour-hood give her, or rather adde unto her a new right, to Rule her ſelfe more perfectly, and to help to Rule Neighbour <hi>Churches</hi> alſo, which ſhe could not do before; ſo it is not <hi>Juriſdictionis diminutio, ſed ampliatio,</hi> it is no diminution, but an augmentation of power <hi>intenſivè,</hi> or in certitude within her ſelfe, and <hi>extenſivè,</hi> in reſpect of other <hi>Churches:</hi> ſo it is a Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God, added to that <hi>Church,</hi> and no power or abilitie, but a lacke of power, a weakeneſſe, an unpowerfulneſſe (as I may ſo ſay) and infirmity ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away; it is not to take away what ſhe had, but to give her a power or helpe, that ſhe had not, being alone; Even ſo as when two or three Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments coming to joyn with one, or two others againſt their common Enemy, theſe two or three Regiments take no power or force from the one, or the two precedent Regiments, but help them, and make them more able to beate the Enemy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>M. S. Thoſe that God hath put together, let not man put aſunder;</hi> But God put together a ſingle <hi>Congregation,</hi> and an entire Iuriſdiction. <hi>Ergo,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A. S.</hi> That Text in the firſt Propoſition is to be expounded of thoſe onely that are put together by <hi>Marriage,</hi> but if you take it Univerſally, it will be found falſe; for God hath put a <hi>Tree,</hi> and the Branches thereof together, and yet I trow you will not ſay, a man may not cut a Branch off from a <hi>Tree.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. I anſwer, if God hath put them together in all caſes, it is true, but the Minor is falſe: If God hath onely put them together in ſome particular <hi>Caſe,</hi> then they may be ſeparated in an other <hi>Caſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. I anſwer to the <hi>Minor;</hi> If by an <hi>entire Iuriſdiction,</hi> be meant a <hi>ſupreme Miniſteriall Juriſdiction</hi> abſolutely, ſuch as ſhould be in <hi>Synods,</hi> to the well-being of the <hi>Church,</hi> it is falſe, for it wants a <hi>Synodall Juriſdiction:</hi> If by an <hi>entire Iuriſdiction</hi> be meant <hi>entire, ſecundum quid, in ſuo genere, &amp; per accidens,</hi> in ſome way, in its own kind, and by Accident, it is true; for ſuch a
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:124638:63"/>Iuriſdiction is onely <hi>Congregationall</hi> or <hi>Conſiſtoriall,</hi> and ſo perfect in that <hi>kinde,</hi> and <hi>ſupreme</hi> by <hi>accident,</hi> for want of Neighbour Churches; ſo it is entire in that <hi>kinde,</hi> but not <hi>abſolutely,</hi> as it ſhould be in Caſe of Neighbour Churches.</p>
                  <p>Maſter <hi>Mather,</hi> and Maſter <hi>Thomſon,</hi> in their Anſwer to Maſter <hi>Herle,</hi> argue thus: The <hi>power</hi> that <hi>floweth immediately,</hi> and <hi>neceſſarily</hi> from the very <hi>Eſſence</hi> of a <hi>Church, cannot</hi> be <hi>ſeparated</hi> from the <hi>Eſſence</hi> of a <hi>particular Church:</hi> But ſuch an entire power of Iuriſdiction <hi>floweth</hi> from the very <hi>Eſſence of a Church. Ergo,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A. S.</hi> 1. I deny the <hi>Minor;</hi> for that, which belongeth to any thing, <hi>ex inſtituto, floweth</hi> not from its <hi>Eſſence:</hi> But ſo it is of the <hi>entireneſſe</hi> of <hi>Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction;</hi> it belongeth not to the <hi>Church</hi> by <hi>nature,</hi> but by <hi>will,</hi> and <hi>Law, viz.</hi> by Gods Ordinance. 2. If it <hi>flowed neceſſarily</hi> from the very <hi>Eſſence</hi> of every <hi>Church,</hi> then could not God <hi>change</hi> it; for God cannot <hi>deſtroy</hi> nor <hi>change</hi> the proper <hi>Accidents,</hi> or take them away from their <hi>ſubjects:</hi> But the <hi>conſequent</hi> is <hi>falſe;</hi> for ſince Iuriſdiction belongs to the <hi>Church</hi> by Gods freewill, he may as freely take it away from the <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>change</hi> it, as he beſtowed it upon the <hi>Church.</hi> 3. Yea, God hath actually changed it; for all the <hi>Militant Churches,</hi> ſince the <hi>fall of Adam, viz.</hi> Before the <hi>Law,</hi> under the <hi>Law,</hi> and under the <hi>Goſpel</hi> are of the ſame <hi>nature,</hi> and <hi>Species,</hi> or the ſame in <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> and onely <hi>differ</hi> in <hi>Circumſtances;</hi> and yet they have had <hi>divers ſorts of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction,</hi> and <hi>Governments,</hi> which <hi>could not</hi> be, if it <hi>flowed immediately and neceſſarily from its Eſſence.</hi> 4. Put the Caſe, it <hi>flowed</hi> from its <hi>Eſſence,</hi> as it doth not; yet this <hi>entireneſſe</hi> of <hi>juriſdiction</hi> ſhould onely be <hi>entireneſſe</hi> of <hi>Conſiſtorian</hi> or <hi>Parochiall juriſdiction,</hi> which is entire in its own <hi>kinde,</hi> but not of <hi>Synodall juriſdiction,</hi> yea, not ſo much, as of your <hi>Synodall</hi> power, in defining dogmatically the points of <hi>Doctrine.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2.

                  <p>
                     <hi>A. S.</hi> The <hi>Antecedent</hi> is not univerſally true, 1. For it is good for Families, Republikes, and Kingdoms, that cannot rule themſelves, that they be ruled by ſome others; and there are ſome people, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> tels us, that are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ſervile. <hi>Ergo,</hi> They have need to be ruled by others. And the <hi>Poloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> ſometimes chuſe Forraign Princes to rule over them: The <hi>Raguſians</hi> in <hi>Slavonia,</hi> to entertain perfect equality amongſt themſelves, chuſe evermore a Stranger for their <hi>Biſhop;</hi> and therefore hold it not evermore beſt, to be ruled by one of themſelves: So do they in ſundry Elective Kingdoms.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Howbeit I ſhould grant, that it is abſolutely beſt, yet ſhould it not follow, that it is beſt for every ſort of Society, every where, and evermore; for then it ſhould follow, 1. That it is not good, much leſſe beſt for us, that <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> who according to his Manhood, or the Apoſtles, who were Iews, ſhould have been Univerſall Miniſters over all the whole World, ſince they were not choſen of every particular Kingdom; much leſſe of every Province, but leaſt of all, of every particular <hi>Independent Congregation</hi> compounded of ſeven or eight weak Fore-headed men, as <hi>M. S.</hi> ſtiles them. 2. It ſhould not be a bleſſing of God, that the Crown of <hi>France</hi> ſhould be ſubject to the Crown of <hi>England;</hi> for ſo it ſhould not be ſubject to a French man; ſo we looſe our right to the Crown of <hi>France.</hi> 3. It ſhould have been a puniſhment to the people of God, to have been ruled by a King of one Tribe, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamine,</hi> as by <hi>Saul;</hi> or of <hi>Iudah,</hi> as by <hi>David, Solomon, Rehoboam, &amp;c.</hi> for they were not of all the Tribes, much leſſe of every particular Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of ſeven or eight perſons. 4. This Maxime cannot ſtand with the State of our three Crowns; for ſo it elſe ſhould be a bleſſing to <hi>Ireland,</hi> to be ruled by one of the Iriſh Rebels, and a puniſhment to be ſubject to the Crown of <hi>England.</hi> 5. By that ſame reaſon the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> could not without ſome puniſhment or curſe of God upon the one or the other, ſubſiſt in an Union together, unleſſe the King were both an Engliſh, and a Scotchman. 6. The <hi>Parliament</hi> could not be a bleſſing, but a curſe of God, ſince the Members thereof are from divers Provinces, Shires, and Burroughes, as the Members of our Nationall Synods. So let the World conſider how Traiterous, how Hereticall, and blaſphemous this moſt abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Maxime is, tending to the totall ſubverſion of the <hi>Church, King, Parliament, State,</hi> and <hi>Kingdoms.</hi> 7. Yea, it overthroweth even their own Maximes; for their Synods are gathered of Members of different <hi>Churches,</hi> as ours are. 8. And finally, Howbeit I ſhould grant him his Maxime; yet, as I have ſaid, particular <hi>Congregations,</hi> by the increaſe and multiplication of <hi>Churches,</hi> and their combination in Synods, looſe not their <hi>entireneſſe</hi> of <hi>juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,</hi> which they had before, <hi>viz.</hi> their <hi>Parochiall, Congregationall,</hi> or ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <hi>Presbyteriall power,</hi> but retain it as formerly.</p>
                  <p>As for thoſe Texts of Scripture, 1. not one of them ſayes, that <hi>entireneſſe of Government</hi> within themſelves, is evermore <hi>beſt,</hi> and a <hi>mercy of God.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. Much leſſe, that <hi>entireneſſe of Government,</hi> within a petty <hi>Independent Church,</hi> compounded of ſeven or eight weak Foreheaded Fellows, is beſt for it; For if it were ſo, we muſt have as many little Popes in the <hi>Church,</hi> and as many Kings in the <hi>State,</hi> as there can be <hi>Independent Churches,</hi> or particular <hi>Iudicatories</hi> in the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The paſſage cited out of <hi>Ierem.</hi> 30.21. ſpeaketh of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as appeareth by the Text; for it is added, <hi>And I will cauſe him to draw neer, and he ſhall approach unto me; For who is this, that engaged his heart to approach unto me, ſaith the Lord:</hi> Now who is this, but Ieſus Chriſt? 1. But Chriſt was not a Governour of one particular Independent Church onely, but of them all; ſo this place concludeth an Univerſall Church, inſtead of an Independent Congregation: 2. Neither can it be expounded of the people of the Iews, after the Captivity; for after it, they had no King from amongſt themſelves, at leaſt ordinarily: For after the Captivity of <hi>Babylon, Zerobabel,</hi> and <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah</hi> were, as it were Vaſſals, to the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> even till <hi>Eſdras</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of <hi>Artaxerxes Longimanus,</hi> that they ſhould ſet it up again in form of a Republike. Afterwards, <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, being pacified towards the lews, by the Interceſſion of <hi>Jaddus,</hi> the High Prieſt, they obtained liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to live after their own Laws: Afterwards <hi>Ptolomaeus,</hi> ſon of <hi>Lagus,</hi> King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> having taken the City, uſed them hardly: No better uſage got they afterwards under <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> the eight King of <hi>Syria.</hi> Hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Government was Ducall, and all their Dukes of the Houſe of <hi>David,</hi> to the number of fifteen, from <hi>Zerobabel</hi> to <hi>Ianna:</hi> Afterwards, the Royall and Eccleſiaſticall power was in the hands of the Prieſts, in the <hi>Aſſamoneans</hi> Family, of the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> the which Government was extraordinary, if not unlawfull; and then the diviſion about the Royall and Sacerdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall power, betwixt the two Brethren, <hi>viz. Ariſtobulus,</hi> and <hi>Hircanus,</hi> who had recourſe to <hi>Pompey,</hi> ſome ſixty yeers before the coming of Chriſt, made them to be reduced under the power of the <hi>Romans;</hi> ſo that this <hi>great bleſſing</hi> of ſo great a Governour, as is mentioned here, cannot be interpreted of any worldly Prince; or if it be ſo, it is liker to the Presbyterian, then to the Independent Government; for the great Sanedrim was, as it were, our Nationall Synod; both taken from amongſt their Brethren: So were the Rulers over Thouſands, Hundreds, Fifties, and Tens, anſwerable to our Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Synods, Claſſes, and ſimple Presbyteries. Under <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> the Senate of <hi>Rome,</hi> made <hi>Herod,</hi> an <hi>Idumean,</hi> King of the Iews; And he, as afterward ſome of the Governours, and Proconſuls of <hi>Syria,</hi> made, and depoſed the High Prieſts, according to their pleaſure; ſo that all this time almoſt, the <hi>Government</hi> of the Iews was ever <hi>Tyrannicall,</hi> and ſo a <hi>puniſhment</hi> rather then any <hi>mercy</hi> of God here promiſed.</p>
                  <p>As for the Text, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 27.8. it is not ſaid, That all things that are here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, are <hi>mercies of God;</hi> but that <hi>Tyrus gloried in them, Verſ.</hi> 3. 2. Neither
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:124638:65"/>were they Governors of one Independent Conſociation, as amongſt the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents: but here there were Superior and Inferior Iudicatories, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Proteſtant Churches.</p>
                  <p>To that Text, <hi>Ioel</hi> 2.17. <hi>Give not thine heritage to reproach, that the Heathen ſhould rule over them: Wherefore ſhould they ſay among the people, Where is their God?</hi> I anſwer, This is only a Prayer, that the Heathen rule not over Gods people: and if there had been any of them tolerated among the people of God, as M. S. pretends, this Prayer would as well hold, as if they had not been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, but had lived as ſtrangers in other Countries: and it appeareth cleerly by the Reaſon that is added, <hi>Wherefore, &amp;c.</hi> i.e. leſt thy Name be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured by ſuch reproaches, as if our God could not deliver us, or as if we had not a God to deliver us. And howbeit it were ſo great a bleſſing, ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more to have Government within themſelves, yet can it not be meant of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent Government in every Colledge or Conſociation, without any ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination to ſuperior Iudicatories, as M.S. hath to prove.</p>
                  <p>To the Text, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.15. <hi>One from amongſt thy Brethren thou ſhalt ſet King over thee: thou mayeſt not ſet a Stranger over thee, which is not thy Brother.</hi> I anſwer, 1. That this is not a Morall, but a Poſitive Law; for in Elective Kingdomes they chooſe Strangers to be Kings, and in ſo doing, they ſinne not againſt the Morall, or the Law of Nature. 2. That this Commandement is only conditionall, grounded upon the condition conteined in the beginning of the Verſe, viz. That only they ſhould <hi>eſtabliſh him for King over them, whom the Lord their God ſhould chooſe.</hi> 3. Neither was this Government <hi>independent</hi> in every Town, or particular Congregation; or without <hi>ſubordination,</hi> as among the <hi>Independents:</hi> but according to the Law of Nature and Grace, with ſome ſubordination and dependence of inferior Iudicatories upon ſome ſuperior. 4. By a <hi>ſtranger</hi> here, I beleeve, that he meanes principally a <hi>ſtranger</hi> in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; and conſequently, by habitation; becauſe it is added, <hi>that is not thy Brother:</hi> item, becauſe he was to have a copy of the <hi>Law, to read it, and learn to feare the Lord his God, to keep all the words thereof:</hi> which the Heathens could not doe. Or, 5. The reaſon may be, becauſe God was minded to tye the Crown to one Family, viz. to that of <hi>Iudah.</hi> 6. Neither was it lawfull for them to chooſe any Brother, or Countryman of theirs, but him only that was of the Tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> at leaſt, after the Promiſe made unto <hi>David;</hi> and that for a ſpeciall Reaſon, viz. to the end wee may know CHRISTS De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>After theſe ſilly Objections that this M.S. hath brought, he objects to himſelf, But Paſtors and Elders of neighbour Churches are not to be looked upon as Strangers, but as Brethren: (And he might have confirmed it; for <hi>there is no diſtinction betwixt the Iew and the Greek,</hi> Rom. 10.12.) and anſwers, That they are Brethren in reſpect of the unbelievers, and yet have more of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Strangers to them, then thoſe that were (as it were) of the ſame do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtique
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:124638:66"/>Society with them; and therefore <hi>ſubjection</hi> unto them muſt have leſſe of the <hi>Bleſſing,</hi> and more of the <hi>Curſe,</hi> then Subjection to their own.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A. S.</hi> I anſwer, 1. in matter of Argumentation, to prove a Categoricall and Abſolute Propoſition, we uſe not theſe, <hi>as it were,</hi> or Metaphoricall termes; for they are <hi>termini diminuentes;</hi> and if it be only, <hi>as it were,</hi> Ergo it is not <hi>really.</hi> 2. I pray you, M.S. tell me, if a man, that is not of your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, and hath more Faith, or at leaſt profeſſeth more then one of your Congregation, What reaſon, that he ſhould rather be a ſtranger unto you, or leſſe your Brother in Chriſt, then he who hath leſſe Faith? 3. Should not he, that hath a greater union with Chriſt, which undoubtedly he hath by his greater Faith, have a greater union with you? I ſee, that he ſhall be leaſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of you, who is moſt beloved of Chriſt, and of whom Chriſt is moſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved. 4. And ſo you eſteem it a greater <hi>curſe</hi> to be ſubject to thoſe who have more Faith, and a greater <hi>bleſſing</hi> to be ſubject to ſuch as have leſſe Faith, and haply none at all: <hi>Siccinè ſoles beare Amicos?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>M. S. 3. <hi>Reaſon:</hi> The Grant of Government and Rule within themſelves, unto Townes and Corporations, was ever eſteemed a matter of ſpeciall Grace and favour from Princes, and hath ſometimes been purchaſed with great ſums of money by the Inhabitants.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A. S.</hi> What followeth? <hi>Ergo,</hi> ſo muſt it be in the Church: if ye conclude any thing at all. 1. So you are the Diſciples of <hi>Simon Magus.</hi> 2. That Grant of Government within themſelves was no Independent Government, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Independent Churches; for then they muſt have been Soveraigns. 3. I retort the Argument: In all ſuch Priviledges of Incorporations, there is evermore a Subordination of Government, as among the Proteſtant Churches: <hi>Ergo,</hi> ſo ſhould it be among you, if you will imitate them, or will have this Argument to make any thing at all for you. 4. Neither could it be a ſpeciall Grace, if it be independent; for Grace is only amongſt the ſuperior and the inferior, dependent upon his ſuperior. 5. Such a Grace ſhould take away the Subjects ſubjection, and ſo of a Prince make no Prince; for no man is Prince, but he, upon whom the Subjects depend.</p>

                  <p>M.S. 1. Reaſon to confirme this Aſſertion. Firſt, in caſe a man be queſtioned, he ſaves a proportion both of time and labour, in reſpect of what he muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe, if he were to make his Anſwer at a Conſiſtorie further off.</p>
                  <p>A. S. <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. He anſwers firſt in his own Pariſh, in his own particular Conſiſtorie, and ſo ſaves his time. 2. But in caſe he be there oppreſſed, it is unjuſt, that he ſhould not have liberty to deſend himſelfe before another, viz. a <hi>Claſſe,</hi> which happily may be holden in his own Town, or within one, two, or three miles of it; which is more tolerable to him, then to be oppreſſed by Factions, as ſundry times men are amongſt the Independents, as appeareth by Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> Relation of the buſineſſe, touched in the <hi>Apologeticall Narration.</hi> 3. What if there fall out ſixe or ſeven ſuch differences among your Churches, and that particular perſons deſire ſome redreſſe of their Grievances before a Synod amongſt you? can ye not hold one Synod for five or ſixe ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints? Then in ſuch a caſe, they muſt all goe to the Synod, out of their own Churches: and then even amongſt your ſelves ye find the ſame inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience that ye object to us: If ye cannot, but for every ſuch Grievance there muſt be a particular Synod, and your Meſſengers of other Churches muſt goe to the place; then many, in ſtead of one, loſe their time and labour. 4. This Reaſon beats down as well the Government of the State; And 5. the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church of the Iewes, which was eſtabliſhed by God himſelfe; And 6. the Proceedings of the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> as of Ours.</p>
                  <p>Secondly (ſaith M.S.) the <hi>Proceedings</hi> againſt him in his own <hi>ſociaty,</hi> ſhall be regulated, managed, and ordered by his own <hi>Paſtor,</hi> who is a <hi>Father</hi> unto him in the Lord, and who in all reaſon, and according to the courſe of almoſt all conſtant experience, is more tender, affectionate, and compaſſionate to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, then the <hi>Paſtors</hi> of other <hi>Fhocks,</hi> and thoſe that are <hi>ſtrangers</hi> to him; <hi>Ergo,</hi> every man ſhould be judged in his owne particular Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</p>
                  <p>A.S. This Argument deſtroyeth no leſſe the Civill, then the Church-Government; for ſo it may be ſaid, that a man being judged by the Iudge of his own ſown, ſhall be more tenderly dealt with then before the Kings Councell. 2. The Government of the Church of the Old Teſtament, as I have already declared. 3. The proceedings of the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> that ſent its <hi>Controverſie</hi> to be judged at Hieruſalem. 4. That of the <hi>Independents</hi> themſelves, who in their Synods pretend to determine matters of Doctrine. 5. I deny the Antecedent; for when either the whole Church, or any mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thereof hath any debate with their own Paſtor, or two Paſtors of one Church amongſt themſelves, or two perſons, or two Paſtors of different Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, or two <hi>Churches</hi> are at odds one with another, that will not hold.</p>

                  <p>A. S. This Argument concludeth 1. againſt the Subordination of Iudicato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in the State. 2. Againſt all ſorts of Courts, wherein he that is ſentenced, cannot ſentence his Iudges againe. 3. Againſt the Eccleſiaſticall proceedings in the Old Teſtament, wherein he that was ſentenced had not evermore power to ſentence his Iudge again. 4. Againſt the proceedings of the Church of <hi>Antioch.</hi> 5. Againſt that of the Independents. 6. Such a proceeding of mutuall judgement, out of feare to be judged againe, will make the Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments partiall, whereas they ſhould be neutrall; and it is no better, then if one ſhould ſay; Sir, looke you favour me this day, otherwiſe expect no favour from me another day. 7. We have no <hi>Conſiſtory</hi> of <hi>ſtanding</hi> Iudges, but the ſimple <hi>Presbytery,</hi> as you have. 8. In our way we are judged by thoſe, who if they doe us wrong, may be judged not by us, who are parties, but by higher and more impartiall Iudges, viz. a ſimple Presbytery by a Claſſe; a Claſſe by a Provinciall Synod; and a Provinciall by a Nationall Synod. And as for that Maxime, <hi>Nunquam ſatis fida potentia, ubi nimia,</hi> it is very true, if it be applyed to your Independent Authority in particular Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. M. S. fourth Reaſon is, becauſe it is a great encouragement to a man that is accuſed, if he be <hi>tender fore-headed,</hi> before thoſe, with whoſe perſon he is well acquainted, and the contrary is a kind of oppreſſion of ſuch a man; <hi>Ergo</hi> he muſt only be judged in his owne Congregation, and Independently.</p>
                  <p>A. S. 1. In firſt inſtance he may be judged, as you ſay. 2. But if he will not ſtand to the ſentence of his owne particular Presbytery, and afterward be changed as you ſay into a ſtone, he getteth no wrong, but what he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured unto himſelfe. 3. But if his party acquieſce not, but <hi>appeale,</hi> yet may he have his owne <hi>Paſtor</hi> at the Claſſe, or Provinciall Synod, to lay open his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:124638:67"/>and it is the duty of the particular Presbytery, Seſſion or Conſiſtory, to make good their Iudgement, ſo as he needs not to feare. 4. And it is the cuſtome of our Presbyteries, Claſſes, and Synods in ſuch a eaſe, to have a care of ſuch perſons, that they receive no wrong. 5. This Reaſon, as the reſt, ſtriketh at the Kings, the Parliaments, and all Civill Magiſtrates Authority as well, ſince they are not familiar with every Cobler. 6. At the Eccleſiaſticall proceedings in the Old Teſtament. 7. And that of Antioch. 8. I deny the conſequence, for theſe Reaſons alleadged.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>M. S.</hi> his 5. Reaſon is, becauſe in this Congregationall Government, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Chriſtians may ſee the judiciall proceedings in the Churth, which will be a Schoole of wiſdome and Experience. But it is not ſo in remote Conſiſtories.</p>
                  <p>

                     </gap>. 1. Such an opportunity may be found in the Presbyteriall way, in their Parochiall Iudicatories, in ſuch matters, as require not ſilence. 2. Neither is it fit, that all ſorts of Perſons, as women, eſpecially young Damoſells, and young men ſhould heare all ſort of buſineſſes, that may be diſcuſſed in thoſe Iudicatories. 3. They have more in our way, for they have our Confeſſion of Faith, and our Diſcipline written, or in Print, and may ſtudy it every day at home, which is not uſuall amongſt the Independents, who are never reſolved, neither in their Confeſſion of Faith, nor in their Government; neither will they have any one, common to all their Churches. If private Chriſtians deſire more then this, they may goe to the Univerſities. 4. This Argument ſtriketh at the Government of the State, that of the Old Teſtament, and at the proceedings of the Apoſtles, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. and 16.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>M. S.</hi> his 6. Arg. in ſubſtance is, that the Premiſſes, whereupon Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are grounded, cannot be ſo well known, and examined in Claſſes, and Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods, as in an Independent Congregation, wherein the matter is paſſed, <hi>Ergo</hi> it ſhould be judged there, and not in Claſſes, Synods, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A. S.</hi> 1. This Argument, as the reſt, concludes, as well againſt the procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings in Civill Iudicatories, that of the Church of the Old Teſtament, that at <hi>Antiochia,</hi> and at <hi>Hieruſalens,</hi> as againſt the Presbyterian way. 2. Amongſt us the buſineſſes are firſt examined before the Parochiall Presbytery, or Seſſion, where all the Premiſſes may be as well tryed, as in the Independent Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation; and in caſe of Appeale they may be carried to the Claſſe, or Synod. 3. What if the difference be betwixt two divers Churches, or two perſons of divers Churches, and the premiſſes be Actions, or Offences committed out of both the Churches; then in ſuch a caſe, the buſineſſe cannot be proved in any of the Churches; what if the buſineſſe need no proofe, but be ſome ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Doctrinc?</p>
                  <p>M. S. addeth, that for brevities ſake he would not ſtrengthen his Arguments as he might. <hi>A. S.</hi> And in this we praiſe his prudence, in publiſhing unto the world ſuch frivolous Arguments, yea that have not ſo much as any apparent probability in them.</p>

               <p>The State of the Queſtion then is, <hi>Whether ſuch Independents ſhould have any Poſitive, or Negative; but principally a Poſitive Toleration, not onely for their Perſons, but alſo for their Churches in this Kingdons, wherein they are not yet admitted.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> This is but a ſtrong imagination of <hi>M. S.</hi> which may as eaſily be denied by us, upon our Reaſon here above alleadged, as it is boldly aſſerted by him, without any Reaſon at all. As for that, which he citeth out of my Book, that I acknowledge them for men of Abilities, ſufficient enough to diſpute their Opinions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> I have anſwered this ſundry times, 1. It is but a judgement of one man. 2. But a judgement of Charity, which howbeit it be Practically true, yet oftentimes it proveth Speculatively falſe. 3. It is not a certain, but a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable judgement, whereof he doth not well to brag ſo much. 4. Howbeit, they may not want Abilities to diſpute probably, yet may they want Abilities to demonſtrate their opinions Theologically: Yea, neither all they, nor ten thouſand, ſuch as <hi>M.S.</hi> with them, ſhall ever be able to bring any ſtrong Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for any one of their Tenets, that they hold againſt us. 5. If they have ſo great Abilities to diſpute their opinions, the Devill hath yet greater: Cannot able Lawyers diſpute very well a very ill Cauſe? Know ye not what is ſaid of a very able man, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi benè, nemo meliùs; ubi malè, nemo pejùs?</hi> Truely, ye diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute with ſuch heat and ardency for the <hi>Independent</hi> learning, and godlineſſe, that it ſeemeth almoſt the onely quarrell ye have againſt us, whether ye be the <hi>learnedſt,</hi> and <hi>godlieſt men in this Kingdom,</hi> or not? You, and they ſeem to maintain the <hi>affirmative,</hi> at leaſt concerning the laſt part of this <hi>Theſis,</hi> if not both; and ſcarcely ſee we any Book of Independency ſet forth, wherein we ſee not great complaìnts, that their Abilities are not high enough prized; And what they ſay of their pretended piety, all the World knoweth; whereas your pretended Adverſaries ſpeak never a word, but of the Cauſe, unleſſe they be provoked by the vain and exorbitant praiſes, that ye ever and anon undeſervedly beſtow upon your ſelves. 6. But how able ſoever you, or they be, yet for them, it is cleer, the Aſſembly hath divers times put them to a non-plus. 7. And if they be ſo <hi>able,</hi> what other reaſon can there be, that they plead no better their Cauſe, fave onely, that it is naught? It is truely a ſtrange thing, that men of ſo great <hi>abilities,</hi> ſhould be able to ſay no more for themſelves. 8. And ſince you <hi>M.S.</hi> and they are ſo able, will you, or they, I pray, conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to ſome private meeting with ſome of the Presbyterians, that it may be

That <hi>to a ſaving knowledge of God, it ſufficeth not to know him in the Book of Nature, or</hi> 2. <hi>as revealed in the holy Scriptures;</hi> but that <hi>we muſt alſo know him as abſtract from his Mercy,</hi> and <hi>all his Attributes.</hi> Now if this be a common Tenet of your Religion, I muſt confeſſe, I am none of yours; My Reaſons are, 1. Becauſe that if it be ſo, rude people, that know nothing of ſo <hi>refined Abſtractions,</hi> muſt be damned. 2. Becauſe, to <hi>be ſaved,</hi> it is moſt neceſſary to know God as <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete with his Mercy,</hi> or as <hi>mercifull towards us in Chriſt.</hi> 3. If I <hi>know God</hi> evermore under this <hi>refined abſtraction from Mercy,</hi> I muſt be <hi>damned.</hi> 4. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, if I know God <hi>abſtracted from his Mercy,</hi> I know him <hi>out of Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>out of the Goſpel;</hi> for God in Chriſt, and in the Goſpel, is not <hi>abſtract,</hi> but <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete</hi> with <hi>Mercy.</hi> 5. Becauſe the <hi>knowledge of God, as revealed in Scripture, is ſufficient to ſalvation, Ergo,</hi> it is not needfull to know him any otherwayes in this life. 6. Becauſe, if I know God <hi>out of Scripture, and abſtract from Mercy,</hi> it is a <hi>Knowledge without Faith;</hi> for Faiths <hi>formall Object</hi> is <hi>God in Chriſt, as revealed in Scripture;</hi> and therefore it is a knowledge of <hi>God in Chriſt, as revealed in Scripture;</hi> and therefore there muſt be ſome <hi>ſaving knowledge of God without Faith.</hi> 7. If a <hi>ſaving knowledge of God</hi> be of God as <hi>abſtract from all his Attributes,</hi> it muſt be a knowledge of God without any <hi>Simplicity,</hi> and ſo of God as <hi>abſtract from a pure Act.</hi> 8. As <hi>abſtract from all his Perfections, i.e.</hi> without all his <hi>Perfections.</hi> 9. <hi>E.</hi> of God, as <hi>abſtract</hi> from his <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> and ſo as without his <hi>Goodnes.</hi> 10. Of God as without <hi>Inſinitie.</hi> 11. Without <hi>Omnipreſence.</hi> 12. Without <hi>Immutability:</hi> 13. Without <hi>Eternity.</hi> 14. Without <hi>Life,</hi> without <hi>Knowledge, Science</hi> or <hi>Wiſdome.</hi> 15. Without any <hi>Will.</hi> 16. Without any <hi>Love</hi> towards Mankind. 17. Without <hi>Hatred</hi> of <hi>Sin</hi> or <hi>Sinners.</hi> 18. Without <hi>Power</hi> or <hi>Omnipotencie.</hi> 19. Without any <hi>Decree</hi> of <hi>Predeſtinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> or <hi>Reprobation.</hi> 20. Without any <hi>Providence</hi> or care of his Creatures. 21. Without <hi>Creation,</hi> and ſo not as <hi>Creator:</hi> For to know God as abſtract from theſe <hi>Attributes,</hi> is to know God as without them: Now who dare ſay, that to know God, as <hi>abſtract</hi> from all thoſe <hi>Attributes,</hi> or <hi>without them,</hi> is a <hi>ſaving knowledge:</hi> This is indeed an <hi>Independent ſaving knowledge,</hi> indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:124638:70"/>on Gods Word, on Chriſt, on Faith, and all Grace; and conſequently <hi>moſt graceleſſe:</hi> 23. To know <hi>God,</hi> as <hi>abſtract</hi> from all his Attributes, is to know God, as <hi>abſtract</hi> from his <hi>Eſſence,</hi> and ſo to know God, as <hi>without himſelf,</hi> or his own <hi>Eſſence</hi> or <hi>Being;</hi> for <hi>Gods Attributes</hi> are not only <hi>eadem cum Eſſentid ut perſonae, ſed &amp; de Eſſentia, de quidditativo ejus conceptu, &amp; praedicatae ejus eſſentialiae,</hi> and ſome of them, <hi>quaſi de ſpecifico ejus conceptu;</hi> from which God can no wayes be <hi>abſtracted.</hi> 24. If God be conſidered, as <hi>abſtract</hi> from all his <hi>Attributes;</hi> it is no more a knowledge of God, but ſome Idol of the <hi>Independents</hi> brains; <hi>ſicque habes meum candorem &amp; veſtrum pariteratro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem:</hi> Now let the Reader judge, which of our two expreſſions is moſt Malignant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M. S.</hi> his third Anſwer comes to this; Grant them their deſires, <hi>i. e.</hi> A full liberty, and they will bray no more then the wilde Aſſe doth, when he hath Graſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> 1. All Hereticks ſay as much, yea, the Devill would be glad to agree with God upon ſuch terms. 2. But God hath forbid the Church to <hi>tolerate</hi> you; 3. In <hi>New England,</hi> they of your Party will <hi>tolerate</hi> no Sects; 4. And ſuch a <hi>Toleration</hi> here cannot but breed all ſorts of Diviſions; Whereas, if there be one onely Diſcipline or Church Government eſtabliſhed, we ſhall have no Diſtractions at all. 5. But how can (I pray unriddle it me) a Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty granted to conteſt and quarrell one with another, ever take away con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations and quarrells? 6. If the Presbyterians be the cauſe of Diviſions, becauſe they <hi>tolerate</hi> not you (as you ſay;) ſo was <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> for not <hi>tolerating, Core, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiron.</hi> Your <hi>Simile</hi> of him, who murthered the Duke of <hi>Burgundie,</hi> will hold, if it be applyed to your Sect; otherwayes, it is altogether impertinent, and beſide the preſent purpoſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M. S.</hi> his fourth Anſwer cometh to this, That in caſe one Government were eſtabliſhed, it would breed as great, or more Factions and Diviſions, then if a <hi>Toleration</hi> were granted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> This Argument concludeth, as well againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> in favour of <hi>Core, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiron,</hi> as againſt us; for if <hi>Moſes</hi> had granted ſuch a <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration</hi> to them, and their Sect, as the <hi>Independents</hi> are now Suitors for, it would not have bred ſuch Diviſions; And if the <hi>non-Toleration</hi> of it breed as great Diviſions, as the <hi>Toleration</hi> of it would have done, what is the cauſe that this <hi>Toleration</hi> of your Sect breedeth ſo many injurious and calumnious Expreſſions againſt the Presbyterians? What would ye not ſay and do, had ye once gotten a <hi>Toleration?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To <hi>M. S.</hi> his fifth Anſwer, That <hi>ſundry perſons of one Family,</hi> in the City, hear <hi>divers Miniſters,</hi> without any Diviſion?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.S.</hi> I anſwer, That thoſe Miniſters are not of <hi>divers Sects,</hi> or if they be, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, it breedeth many Diviſions, and alienates their mindes one from another: Neither can any Godly good man, who is bound by duty to have a
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:124638:71"/>care of his Family, but be grieved, when he ſeeth his Children, his Wife, and Servants ſeparated in affection from him, and the Church, wherein he ſerveth God, and to eat at his Table in his Houſe, when they will not eat at the Lords Table with him, in the Houſe of God.</p>
               <p>What ye ſay of a <hi>Houſe of bondage;</hi> if we were all under one Government, it is moſt falſe; For by the ſame Reaſon, the People of God ſhould have been in an <hi>Houſe of bondage,</hi> when they came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and were brought into the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> becauſe that there they had <hi>but one Government.</hi> So with you it muſt be an <hi>Houſe of bondage,</hi> in every State, that hath but <hi>one ſort of Civil Government.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will not anſwer his vain vaunting, in extolling his own Sect: Onely I wonder, that he is offended at us, that we deſire but one good Government, what ever it be; Is it ill to have but one good Government? Wherefore does he plead for many ill Governments? Wherefore will not thoſe of <hi>New England</hi> admit many, if it be ſo good? If it be want of Mercy not to <hi>tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi> others, how mercileſſe were the Mercies of <hi>New England,</hi> that would not <hi>tolerate</hi> Presbyterians, no not in a corner of their Countrey, when their Necks were put in the Pillories, their Noſes ſlitted, their Ears cut, and their perſons impriſoned?</p>
               <p>What <hi>M. S.</hi> ſayeth of <hi>diſtractions of mindes,</hi> under Epiſcopall Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; it was not for want of a <hi>Toleration</hi> of <hi>all Sects, and all ſort of Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall Governments:</hi> Neither have I ever heard of any Petition made about it, much leſſe for any Independent Government.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M. S.</hi> And where Conſcience is tender, a little violence is a great torment to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> It hath been told you, twenty times; 1. That no man <hi>violateth</hi> or <hi>forceth</hi> your <hi>Conſciences;</hi> 2. And all Sects bring the ſame pretext of <hi>tender Conſciences.</hi> 3. And we tell you again, That your wayes are not wayes of <hi>tender,</hi> but of <hi>turbulent Conſciences.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> 3. Argument. No State in Chriſtendom, where there is one onely Religion eſtabliſhed, will admit the publike exerciſe of any other, or endure a Schiſm in that, which is already received: Wherefore then ſhould it be done here?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M. S.</hi> his third Reaſon, 1. Suppoſeth that malignant Suppoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> That Presbytery and Apologiſm, make two differing Religions. 2. That there is no State in Chriſtendom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3. That <hi>Apologiſm,</hi> in caſe it be <hi>tolerated,</hi> muſt needs become a <hi>Schiſm,</hi> in that Religion, which is eſtabliſhed in the Land.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> To the firſt I anſwer, 1. That neither I do ſuppoſe, nor yet can ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe any ſuch thing; For we ſee no common Confeſſion of Faith of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologiſm;</hi> neither will the <hi>Apologiſts</hi> be known or declare their Tenets; but are evermore in the Synod, and out of the Synod, obſerving what is there
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:124638:71"/>ſaid or done, taking their advantage upon all occaſions, and ſhaping their Tenets, according to the current of the times.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the word, <hi>Religion,</hi> be taken in a large ſignification, as it containeth in it ſelf both <hi>doctrine</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> then the Independents are of a different <hi>Religion</hi> from us, ſince their <hi>Diſcipline</hi> is altogether different.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If it be taken for a <hi>potentiall part of Juſtice,</hi> which inclineth the will to honour God; then the Independents differ from us in <hi>very many acts of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> both in thoſe that it <hi>exerciſeth,</hi> whether they be <hi>internall</hi> or <hi>externall,</hi> and in thoſe, that it <hi>commands</hi> to other vertues; and conſequently in Religion it ſelf; For they have much ſuperſtition in the Acts of their Religion; 1. In reſpect of the perſons, in that they make every man a Miniſter, to Preach, and to Rule. 2. In their Sacraments, in that they take their ſelves to be ſo holy, that no Proteſtant, yea, though he ſo live, as that he give no offence to any man, is yet worthy of their Communion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it be taken for the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Faith;</hi> We know not the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of their <hi>Churches,</hi> ſince they are all Independent one upon another; but as for that of particular Independent Perſons, Maſter <hi>Goodwins</hi> Religion of <hi>Coal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſtreet</hi> (who is thought to be an Independent, and matriculated into the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent Society) is a Religion different from ours, as appeareth by his Books, which are blamed by the beſt Miniſters of <hi>London,</hi> whereof ſome of them have written againſt him: So is that of that other moſt famous Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, who preached not long ago at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> of ſome of whoſe Doctrines, I gave you a ſhort relation, but even now.</p>
               <p>As for the ſecond Suppoſition, <hi>M. S.</hi> he ſaith, that it is manifeſtly untrue, as it is notoriouſly known in <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>Low-Countries, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> But it is notoriouſly known in <hi>France,</hi> that it is againſt the will of the <hi>State,</hi> and of all <hi>Papiſts,</hi> that <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are <hi>tolerated</hi> there, as it appeareth evidently;
<list>
                     <item>1. By ſo many bloody Maſſacres, and Butcheries of the Proteſtants there.</item>
                     <item>2. By ſo many Wars, whereby they obtained a Liberty of Conſcience.</item>
                     <item>3. They had many Princes of the Royall Blood for them, who were Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants; many Officers of the Crown; many of the Parliament in <hi>Paris;</hi> and finally, King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, who in the beginning was a Proteſtant, to whom by Succeſſion belonged the Crown; for whoſe right they ſought very ſtoutly in ſundry Battels, furniſhed him with men and moneys for the War; And he after his externall revoult, remaining evermore a Proteſtant in his heart, as it is commonly beleeved; and fearing the Jeſuiticall Faction, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of their good ſervice, granted them Liberty of their Conſciences, Free Exerciſe of their Religion, and Towns of ſurety and ſecurity: therefore they obtained then their Liberties by the Sword; And afterward, they were confirmed by Law, but ſore againſt the State, and the Papiſts will: And all this notwithſtanding, the Papiſticall Sect evermore undermines them, and by
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:124638:72"/>little and little, againſt all Law, cuts them ſhort of thoſe Liberties, ſo deerly purchaſed by them.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>But if you take <hi>France,</hi> for ſuch a Refuge for Libertiniſm, you would do well to try, whether ye can ſettle a Colony of yours there; I beleeve you would quickly experiment it, how little favour ye ſhould receive there, in reſpect of that you have already received of your own Countrey-men.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> if there were but one <hi>Religion</hi> there, they would not <hi>tolerate</hi> any other; And what they have done in <hi>tolerating many,</hi> it is not ſo much <hi>will,</hi> as <hi>neceſſity,</hi> that hath forced them to do ſo: And the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies how unwilling they were in the beginning, to grant any <hi>Toleration</hi> at all to the Papiſts, where they were already eſtabliſhed. If yours of late have been <hi>tolerated</hi> there; 1. It was, becauſe ye taught not there in their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, but in <hi>Engliſh</hi> to <hi>Engliſh</hi> men. 2. And there ye profeſſed not (for any thing we know) that Presbyteriall Government was Epiſcopall, or contrary to Gods Word, as ye do here. 3. They beleeved, that if ye could have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the Exerciſe of Presbyteriall Government in <hi>England,</hi> ye would not have been ſo averſe from it, as ye are. 4. We know not whether your <hi>Religion</hi> was <hi>tolerated</hi> by the <hi>States Generall;</hi> or whether it was <hi>tolerated Poſitive</hi> or <hi>Negativè.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third Suppoſition is true. But <hi>M. S.</hi> replieth, or rather anſwereth, That every difference in judgement doth not make a Schiſm in that <hi>Religion,</hi> which is profeſſed on both ſides.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> Neither ſaid I any ſuch thing. But <hi>M. S.</hi> here giveth himſelf much to do, with many long and idle diſcourſes, without any reaſon at all. If he deſire to know what Independency is, whether an Hereſie, or a Schiſm? I have evermore dealt fairly with him, I have given a <hi>Definition</hi> of both. <hi>Hereſie is an errour in part, in matters of Faith, in him, who once profeſſed it, whereof he being ſufficiently convicted, yet he continueth, and pertinaciouſly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeveres in it:</hi> But <hi>Schiſm is a breach of Chriſtian Charitie onely, whereby men ſeparate themſelves from the Communion of the true Church; and after ſufficient Conviction, pertinaciouſly perſevere in the ſame.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here I take <hi>Hereſie</hi> and <hi>Schiſm</hi> in a <hi>ſtrict</hi> ſignification, as they are taken by <hi>Divines,</hi> both Proteſtants and Schoolmen, when they diſtinguiſh them, one from another. If he admit theſe <hi>Definitions,</hi> which are ordinarily approved of in the Schools; we may examine thereby the Independency, and ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be a <hi>Schiſm</hi> or an <hi>Hereſie,</hi> or not: If he reject it, I would pray him, to give us ſome better one: I ſay not that Independency is a <hi>Schiſm,</hi> or that the Independent Churches are <hi>Schiſmaticall,</hi> for ſome diverſity of Opinion; for that belongeth rather to <hi>Hereſie,</hi> then to <hi>Schiſm:</hi> Nor 2. that it is a <hi>Schiſm,</hi> becauſe that it is <hi>tolerated,</hi> or <hi>not tolerated;</hi> for <hi>Toleration</hi> is a Conſequent of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> and Extrinſecall to it; The true Reaſon wherefore it is a <hi>Schiſm,</hi> and they <hi>Schiſmaticall,</hi> is becauſe it is a breach of <hi>Charity,</hi> in that they ſeparate
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:124638:72"/>themſelves from the Communion of the true <hi>Church,</hi> yea and from all the true <hi>Churches</hi> in the World, both in Sacramentall Communion, and that of Diſcipline: Neither is it a <hi>Schiſme,</hi> becauſe that it is a ſeparation from <hi>Presbyteriall Churches</hi> preciſely, under the notion of <hi>Presbyteriall,</hi> but of true and Orthodox <hi>Churches,</hi> which preſſe them no wayes to be Actors in any thing againſt their Conſciences.</p>
               <p>But <hi>M. S.</hi> in deſpite of all reaſon will prove, that I cannot convict the <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents</hi> of <hi>Schiſme,</hi> and that by this his moſt ſeriall Argument, which here I put in forme, with all the force it can have;</p>
               <p>He that knoweth not, what is <hi>Schiſm,</hi> cannot convict the <hi>Independents</hi> of <hi>Schiſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, <hi>A. S.</hi> knoweth not what is <hi>Schiſme. Ergo,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> cannot convict the <hi>Independents</hi> of <hi>Schiſme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Major is certain; The Minor, he proveth thus; He that knoweth not what is the <hi>Church,</hi> knoweth not what is <hi>Schiſme,</hi> or a <hi>rent</hi> of the <hi>Church;</hi> For <hi>Rectum eſt Index ſui et obliqui:</hi> and <hi>entia privativa Cognoſcuntur ex ſuis poſitivis &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>A. S.</hi> knoweth not what is the <hi>Church;</hi> for he ſayeth, we know not wherein conſiſts its <hi>Eſſence,</hi> p. 21. <hi>Ergo:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> I anſwer to the firſt Argument, that the Minor is falſe, as appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by the Difinition that I have given of it, both in my <hi>Annotations</hi> upon the Apologeticall Narration; in my Anſwer unto a Libell of <hi>C. C.</hi> and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, ſomewhere in this Booke, againſt the which <hi>M. S.</hi> had nothing to reply.</p>
               <p>To the confirmation of the Minor, I anſwer, that if by the word, <hi>knoweth, M. S.</hi> meaneth a <hi>diſtinct knowledge</hi> of the <hi>Eſſentiall parts</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> the Major is falſe; for <hi>Schiſme</hi> is not a <hi>renting</hi> of the <hi>Eſſentiall parts</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> or of its <hi>tranſcendentall</hi> or <hi>Metaphyſicall <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> but of its <hi>integrant parts,</hi> and <hi>integrant <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity;</hi> for the firſt cannot be deſtroyed, ſo long as it is a true <hi>Church:</hi> And <hi>Schiſmaticall Churches</hi> may have their <hi>tranſcendent u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, verity,</hi> and <hi>goodneſſe,</hi> howſoever they looſe their <hi>integrant unity, verity,</hi> and <hi>goodneſſe:</hi> If by the word, <hi>knoweth,</hi> he meane any <hi>knowledge</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> either <hi>confuſed</hi> or <hi>diſtinct,</hi> whereby we may <hi>know</hi> the <hi>Church,</hi> by her <hi>externall Cauſes,</hi> her <hi>integrant parts,</hi> her <hi>Accidents, &amp;c.</hi> The Minor is falſe, for not onely <hi>A. S.</hi> but little Children at Schoole have ſuch a <hi>knowledge</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> which they learn in their <hi>Catechiſmes,</hi> And by any ſuch <hi>confuſe</hi> or <hi>diſtinct knowledge</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> by her <hi>Cauſes, Accidents,</hi> or <hi>Effects, &amp;c.</hi> we may <hi>confuſedly,</hi> or <hi>diſtinctly know,</hi> what is <hi>Schiſme,</hi> howbeit not <hi>Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially.</hi>

               <p>As for the Confirmation of the Minor; By my words, I ſayd not there, that I knew not what the <hi>Church</hi> is <hi>confuſedly,</hi> or <hi>diſtinctly</hi> by her <hi>Cauſes, inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant parts,</hi> her <hi>Accidents, &amp;c.</hi> But that we know not <hi>diſtinctly</hi> the <hi>Eſſences</hi> of things, as <hi>diſtinguiſhed</hi> from their <hi>Accidents,</hi> as the Reader may ſee, if he
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:124638:73"/>looke in my Booke; for there, in that page 21. I ſpeake in <hi>formall</hi> termes of that, which is <hi>Eſſentiall</hi> to the <hi>Church:</hi> Now if <hi>M. S.</hi> pretend to any ſuch profound knowledge of things, we muſt confeſſe him to be an other <hi>Epiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi> Doctor <hi>du Molin, Profeſſor</hi> in Divinity at <hi>Sedan,</hi> holds the ſame Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, in his <hi>Theſis de Summo Bono:</hi> So did the other <hi>Profeſſors</hi> of Divinity there; for they ſay, that no Creature, neither in this life, nor in the life to come, yea, not the very Angels know the <hi>Eſſence</hi> of any thing; And from thence they conclude, that we ſhall not ſee the <hi>Eſſence</hi> of God in the life to come: The which Aſſertion, howſoever I confeſſe it to be true, <hi>de hominibus viatoribus:</hi> yet can I not beleeve it to be true, <hi>de Angelis viatoribus;</hi> and much leſſe <hi>de Angelis, aut hominibus comprehenſoribus: M. S.</hi> ſhould have done better, to have Anſwered my Reaſons that I bring there pag. 21. then ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the light of his Conſcience, to ſcratch at a known truth: Neither can I beleeve him to be ſo ignorant, as not to know, and acknowledge the truth of it in himſelfe, however out of deſire of Conteſtation he manifeſts the contrary.</p>
               <p>But <hi>M. S.</hi> to the end he ſeeme not altogether impertinent, proveth it by an Argument taken <hi>ab Exemplo;</hi> or by an imperfect <hi>Induction;</hi> if it be not a <hi>Pari;</hi> or from them altogether.</p>
               <p>I cannot beleeve (ſaith he) that he ſhould perfectly <hi>know</hi> the <hi>nature</hi> of <hi>dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> that is <hi>ignorant</hi> of what belongeth to the <hi>nature</hi> of <hi>light;</hi> Nor that he ſhould know what a <hi>Schiſme</hi> or <hi>Rent</hi> meanes, that knowes not what belongs to the nature of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> and <hi>Entireneſſe</hi> of the Body; for <hi>Rectum eſt index ſui, &amp; obliqui,</hi> and <hi>Entia privativa cognoſcuntur ex ſuis poſitivis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.S.</hi> We know not perfectly the <hi>nature</hi> of <hi>Light,</hi> and conſequently we know not perfectly the <hi>nature</hi> of <hi>Darkneſſe;</hi> if to <hi>know perfectly,</hi> be taken for a <hi>diſtinct knowledge</hi> of its <hi>Eſſence,</hi> as diſtingniſhed from its <hi>Accidents:</hi> onely we know <hi>light</hi> imperfectly, by its <hi>externall cauſes,</hi> by its <hi>effects,</hi> by its <hi>ſubject, adjuncts,</hi> &amp;c. and not <hi>eſſentially.</hi> And as for your firſt Maxime, <hi>Rectum eſt index ſui, &amp; obliqui;</hi> it is true; <hi>ſed non per diſtinctum aliquem conceptum ſui eſſentialem,</hi> as Philoſophers ſay. Your ſecond Maxime, whomſoever you imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate in that Expreſſion, is improper; for <hi>Privations</hi> are not properly <hi>Entia privativa,</hi> but <hi>Entium privationes,</hi> not <hi>Eſſences</hi> or <hi>Beings,</hi> but <hi>negations</hi> of <hi>Being;</hi> neither is <hi>Darkneſſe</hi> any thing but a <hi>negation</hi> of ſomething, viz. of <hi>Light:</hi> ſo <hi>Poverty</hi> is not a <hi>thing,</hi> but a want of ſome <hi>thing,</hi> viz. of <hi>Riches.</hi> 2. But I will pardon him this miſtake: howbeit it were true, yet followeth it not, that if I know a <hi>Privation</hi> by the <hi>Poſitive Forme</hi> which it deſtroyeth, that I know that <hi>Forme eſſentially,</hi> by its Eſſence, and in it ſelfe: I know the Forme only <hi>accidentally,</hi> or by its <hi>extrinſecall cauſes,</hi> or by its <hi>Exiſtence.</hi> 3. <hi>Item,</hi> So we conceive <hi>Privations,</hi> under the notion of <hi>Negations,</hi> or <hi>deſtructions</hi> of the <hi>Exiſtences,</hi> rather then of the <hi>Eſſences</hi> of things; or at moſt, as <hi>deſtructions</hi> of the Exiſtence <hi>primario;</hi> and of the Eſſence <hi>ſecundariò,</hi> if they be deſtroyed
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:124638:73"/>by <hi>Privations:</hi> Neither can I beleeve, that the <hi>Fire</hi> burneth and deſtroyeth immediately the <hi>Eſſence</hi> of a Man, or any part thereof; for the <hi>Reaſonable ſoule</hi> is <hi>ſpirituall,</hi> and cannot be <hi>burnt;</hi> ſo is the other part of his <hi>Eſſence,</hi> viz. his <hi>materia prima,</hi> incombuſtible, yea naturally incorruptible: and as for the <hi>Phyſicall eſſence</hi> of the whole man, when <hi>M. S.</hi> ſhall declare wherein it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts, I ſhall diſpute with him: But, ſilly man, with this babling Logick, knows he not that <hi>Accidents</hi> are never defined by their <hi>Eſſentiall differences,</hi> but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermore by their <hi>Externall Cauſes,</hi> or by their <hi>Accidents;</hi> and ſometimes by their <hi>Oppoſites,</hi> and <hi>Negations</hi> of ſome other things: The very Apprentices in Logick know thus much. 4. But if we know the <hi>Eſſences</hi> of things in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as this <hi>M.S.</hi> pretends, if he ſay any thing to purpoſe, how is it, that there is ſo great debate about them? as 1. about the <hi>ſoule</hi> of a man, whether it be <hi>ſpirituall</hi> or <hi>corporall?</hi> 2. About the <hi>totall Eſſence</hi> of a man, whether it be the Soule alone? his Soule and Body? the Soule and its <hi>materia prima?</hi> the <hi>union of both,</hi> the <hi>image of God, Religion,</hi> or ſome other thing? And to urge this more home upon your Example of the <hi>Light;</hi> If we know the <hi>Eſſences</hi> of things diſtinctly, and in themſelves, as I ſaid, what is the cauſe of ſo great a diverſity, yea of ſo great a contrariety of opinions about its <hi>Eſſence</hi> or <hi>Nature?</hi> How is it, that ſome Philoſophers hold it to be in ſome <hi>Predicament,</hi> others to be in none? ſome, to be a <hi>Subſtance,</hi> others an <hi>Accident?</hi> ſome, to be a <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ſubſtance,</hi> others, to be a <hi>Body;</hi> others, neither, viz. neither to be a <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreall,</hi> nor a <hi>ſpirituall,</hi> but a <hi>ſpiritalis ſubſtantia;</hi> others, the preſence of a <hi>lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous body;</hi> others, a <hi>reall colour;</hi> others, an <hi>apparent colour;</hi> others, a <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Quality;</hi> ſome, a <hi>naturall power;</hi> others, a <hi>ſenſible quality?</hi> If we knew it <hi>eſſentially</hi> and <hi>diſtinctly</hi> in it ſelf, and not meerly <hi>accidentally,</hi> we could not ſo doubt of its <hi>Eſſence,</hi> wherein it conſiſts. But it ſeems, that this Man, Doctor <hi>Holmes,</hi> and ſome of that Sect, are as Hereticall in Philoſophie, as Schiſmaticall in Divinitie; and ſo they have conſpired with as little ſucceſſe againſt Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, as againſt Divine truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M.S.</hi> ſayes, that my meaning may be, that if a <hi>Toleration</hi> be granted for <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependencie,</hi> the Practice of it ſhould become a Schiſme from the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.S.</hi> No ſuch thing; but I maintain, that <hi>Independencie</hi> is already, at leaſt <hi>materially,</hi> yea <hi>Formally, ratione Formae eſſentialis, &amp; in foro Conſcientiae interno,</hi> a <hi>ſchiſme</hi> from all the true Churches in the World, ſince they willingly have ſeparated themſelves from them all in matter of Sacramentall Communion, as alſo in that of Diſcipline: And you ſhould have done well to have anſwered this, which no doubt you met with in my former Book; and not oblige me to repeat it here. It will alſo be a Schiſme <hi>ratione Formae Accidentalis externae, &amp; in fore externo,</hi> from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> if, in Gods mercy, any other <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> then <hi>Independent,</hi> be eſtabliſhed in it. So is it alſo, in reſpect of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Church, which is already eſtabliſhed in <hi>France, Holland, &amp;c.</hi>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:124638:74"/>yea and here in <hi>England,</hi> in the <hi>French, Dutch, Italian,</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh Churches.</hi> So is it in reſpect of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Scotland;</hi> the <hi>Diſcipline</hi> whereof is approved by the King, which ye have all ſworne to maintain.</p>
               <p>But, ſayes he, we have no <hi>Presbyterian Church</hi> among us; and ſo if a <hi>Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> be granted, before ſuch a <hi>Government</hi> be eſtabliſhed, it is apparently <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> out of the reach of ſuch an imputation for ever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> 1. It is falſe, that we have no <hi>Presbyterian Church</hi> among us; We have it in the <hi>French, Dutch,</hi> and other Churches, wherewith the <hi>Church of England</hi> profeſſed evermore a <hi>Sacramentall Communion,</hi> which the <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents</hi> break. 2. Whether it be granted by the <hi>Parliament,</hi> or not, that hinders it not from being a <hi>Schiſme;</hi> for the <hi>Toleration</hi> of the <hi>Parliament</hi> is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether <hi>extrinſecall</hi> to <hi>Schiſme;</hi> and there were Schiſmes in the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> without any <hi>Toleration</hi> of the <hi>Civill Magiſtrate.</hi> 3. His Suppoſition is impious and ridiculous; for <hi>Toleration,</hi> according to M.S. his judgement, is evermore of ſome reall, or at leaſt of ſome apparent Evill: Now, can the <hi>Parliament,</hi> or the <hi>Aſſembly of Divines,</hi> in good Conſcience, <hi>tolerate</hi> an <hi>ill Government,</hi> before that they eſtabliſh any <hi>good one?</hi> Is not that to begin with the Devill to ſerve him, before that we ſerve God? Should not the <hi>Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament</hi> begin with You, as the moſt conſiderable Party?</p>
               <p>A. S. his 4. Reaſon. If a <hi>Toleration</hi> be granted to our Brethren, I cannot ſee, how it can be well denied to other Sects.</p>
               <p>M.S. anſwereth, that <hi>Bernardus non videt omnia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A.S. But I pray you then, Father <hi>Epiſtemon,</hi> that ſees all things, make me, by ſome Reaſon or other, to ſee how it can be denyed to other Sects; for there is the ſame Reaſon for a Toleration of them all.</p>
               <p>M.S. bringeth this Reaſon: He (ſaith he) that keepeth a doore with lock and key, and bolts to it, may let in one man, that knocks, without letting in all commers.</p>
               <p>A.S. But if the other knocketh alſo, wherefore will he not open to him, and let him in as well as the other? If he open not, there is no <hi>Reaſon,</hi> but <hi>Will</hi> that keeps him out; ſo there is the <hi>ſame Reaſon,</hi> but not the <hi>ſame Will</hi> for both: it is a meere <hi>Proſopolepſiia,</hi> or Acceptation of perſons, which is not well done.</p>
               <p>If it be ſaid, that other Sects differ more from us, then the <hi>Independents: Anſ.</hi> 1. It is all one; <hi>Magis &amp; minus non mutant ſpeciem,</hi> in matter of <hi>Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration:</hi> 1. For then all muſt be <hi>tolerated;</hi> howſoever ſome more, ſome leſſe: 2. And ſome of our Brethren, <hi>viz.</hi> M. S. grants all the Argument. 3. And if we diſtinguiſh ſo, they muſt declare and expound cleerly, what Sects, and what Opinions are to be <hi>tolerated,</hi> and what not: which will be a Queſtion inextricable, which no mortall man, appearingly, is able diſtinctly to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</p>
               <p>M. S. anſwereth not to any of my Reaſons; only he is offended, that I ſay,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:124638:74"/>it is a Queſtion inextricable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He ſayes then, 1. That I prevaricate with my own Cauſe: but wherein, here <hi>altum ſilentium.</hi> 2. He ſaith, that <hi>I put the Magiſtrate to a ſtand,</hi> whether he ſhould <hi>tolerate Presbyterian Government,</hi> or not. But I have already anſwered; 1. That it is already approved here in <hi>England,</hi> in the <hi>French, Dutch, Italian,</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh Churches;</hi> 2. That the <hi>Engliſh Divines,</hi> in the name of all this Kingdom, approved it in <hi>Holland.</hi> 3. That the <hi>Kings Majeſtie</hi> confirmed it in <hi>Scotland.</hi> 4. That we entertain <hi>Sacramentall Communion</hi> with all the <hi>Proteſtant Reformed Churches;</hi> and that the <hi>Independents</hi> alone do quit it. 5. That all the <hi>three Kingdoms,</hi> and the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents</hi> with them, by their <hi>Covenant and Oath,</hi> are bound to maintain <hi>Presbyteriall Government</hi> in <hi>Scotland.</hi> 6. And they are bound to Reform the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> according to the example of the beſt <hi>Reformed Proteſtant Churches,</hi> and namely that of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which all have onely <hi>Presbyterian Government.</hi> 7. And we have ſufficiently confirmed it by ſundry Teſtimonies of Scripture, and other Arguments, grounded on Scripture. 8. Neither is this his Queſtion to the purpoſe; for <hi>quaeſtio quaeſtionem non ſolvit:</hi> I ask him what Sects are to be tolerated in a <hi>Kingdom,</hi> wherein the <hi>true Doctrine,</hi> and <hi>true Diſcipline,</hi> according to the <hi>publike Judgement,</hi> both of the <hi>State,</hi> and of the <hi>Church,</hi> are <hi>eſtabliſhed:</hi> I maintain, that no <hi>other,</hi> according to Gods Word, ſhould be <hi>tolerated:</hi> The <hi>Independents</hi> maintain, that <hi>theirs</hi> ſhould be <hi>tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:</hi> I reply; if ſo; why not others alſo? To this <hi>M. S.</hi> can ſay nothing, but <hi>will</hi> is the cauſe of it, and that <hi>Presbyterianiſm,</hi> according to this Reaſon, cannot be <hi>tolerated:</hi> I have proved the contrary; and am ready to grant, that if it be a <hi>Sect,</hi> as <hi>theirs</hi> is; or if the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State</hi> judge it to be <hi>repugnant</hi> to Gods Word, it ſhould not be <hi>tolerated;</hi> but ſo have they not done: yea, they have declared the contrary; the <hi>Parliament</hi> in their <hi>Covenant,</hi> and the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> in <hi>giving thanks</hi> to the <hi>Scots Commiſſioners</hi> for their Book. 9. And to be ſhort, I adjure thee <hi>M. S.</hi> by the reliques of thy Conſcience, and pray all men, fearing God, to declare, whether or not, in <hi>taking</hi> of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and in <hi>ſwearing</hi> ſo <hi>ſolemnly,</hi> according to their power, to put down <hi>Popery, Prelacy,</hi> and all <hi>Schiſms,</hi> they intended to <hi>tolerate them all,</hi> as <hi>M.

This is no Law of Eccleſiaſticall Government, or of To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration of Hereſies, Schiſms, or divers Diſciplines in the Church; but a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Law, and a part of the ſixth Commandment, in not offering violence to the weaker; And of the eighth, <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſteal,</hi> forbidding all ſort of Extortion againſt the poor: Now ye are not poor, neither is there any man, either of the Parliament or Synod, about to take your Purſe.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> 1. Your Argument is ſo ſpirituall, that we cannot underſtand it; <hi>Theologia ſymbolica non eſt argumentativa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. We ſay, it is no violence, to oblige all to be ſubject unto Gods Ordinances.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>M. S.</hi> telleth us, <hi>pag.</hi> 90. in caſe the <hi>Minor</hi> part in that Nation, had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented from the <hi>Major,</hi> about the ſence of ſuch or ſuch a Law, relating unto practiſe, and ſo had diſſented in this practiſe: In caſe the <hi>Major</hi> part had taken the advantage of their Brethrens weakneſſe, and becauſe they were fewer in number, ſhould have forced them againſt the light of their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:124638:76"/>to have altered their practiſe, or if they refuſed, ſhould have trodden and trampled upon them, it ſhould have been as apparent a breach of the Laws we ſpeak of, as any oppreſſion in Civill Proceedings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> If the Major part, In ſuch a caſe, had oppreſſed the Minor part, in conſideration of their weakneſſe, or becauſe of their weakneſſe, it would have been true; but if the Major part in not forcing the Minor, to be Actors in any thing againſt their conſcience, had hindered it from bringing in of a new Religion, and a new Diſcipline, againſt that, which was ordained by God, it had been no oppreſſion, no violence, but an act of obedience to their God. And as for that pretext of the tenderneſſe of Conſcience, it is the common refuge of all Hereticks and Schiſmaticks of the World: Your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended tenderneſſe of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               <p>
                  <hi>M. S.</hi> telleth us again, That to conſcientious men, Civill Liberty, without Liberty of Conſcience, is of little value.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> The greateſt Liberty, that Conſcientious men can deſire, is to ſerve God, and to obey his Ordinances; and what is beſide that, is not Liberty, but Licenciouſneſſe: If ye value not ſuch a Liberty, ye are not worthy of it? You may have Liberty of Conſcience, howbeit ye eſtabliſh no <hi>new Diſcipline</hi> in the Kingdom.</p>

Though God gave no ſuch <hi>Toleration,</hi> as you ſpeak of, by <hi>Law,</hi> yet he did actually <hi>tolerate</hi> for a long time together, with much patience, not onely a Minor, but a Major part of the Jewiſh Nation, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the whole Nation fourty yeers, in opinions note riouſly ſinfull, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.18. So then you muſt <hi>tolerate</hi> your Brethren, not onely in ſome Opinions and Practiſes, which are Dialectically and Topically evill, but even alſo in thoſe, which are Demonſtratively ſuch; if you will follow the practiſe of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> I anſwer, 1. to the <hi>Antecedent,</hi> That God <hi>tolerated</hi> not the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in their ſin abſolutely; for ſundry times he puniſhed their ſins, and that very grievouſly with peſtilence, mortality, and making of them a prey unto their Enemies, till ſuch time as they repented and turned from their ſin unto him, and then he turned his anger from them; yea, <hi>Core, Dathan, Abiron,</hi> and their Adherents, for their Schiſm, were ſwallowed up quick by the Earth; and <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Mirian,</hi> ſtrucken with Leproſie; and God kept them all in the Wilderneſſe, as in a Priſon, for the ſpace of fourty yeers, and ſuffered none of them to enter into the <hi>Land of Promiſe:</hi> Onely he <hi>tolerated</hi> them, in not puniſhing them by eternall death, or <hi>ex condigno.</hi> 2. Neither did God make any Law in favour of their ſin, to <hi>tolerate</hi> it, as the <hi>Independents</hi> require here.
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:124638:76"/>3. Howbeit, God himſelf <hi>tolerated</hi> much in them, yet ordained he not, that <hi>Church-men</hi> and the <hi>Civill Magiſtrate</hi> ſhould <hi>tolerate</hi> them, but commanded them both to oppoſe, every one according to their Vocation, and ordained ſundry puniſhments againſt ſuch kindes of ſin in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap> Law.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I deny the Conſequence. 1. For God is the Soveraign Legiſlator, or Lawgiver, who may diſpence with his own Law, and remit ſin committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, but ſo cannot we. 2. Becauſe we are ſubject to the Law, and muſt obey it; ſo is it not with God. 3. We are bound by a particular Obligation, and Duty, to put it in execution; ſo is it not of God. 4. By the ſame reaſon, ye may conclude as well, That we muſt pardon ſins, give our Children to death for other mens ſins, or create a World, if we will follow Gods pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe: 5. Gods practiſe is not to be followed by man, but in that, which is conform to his Law, and his revealed Word; For <hi>Chriſts Church</hi> is a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, wherein his people live not, by cuſtome, or imitation of practiſe, but by Law: Wherefore ſince there is no Law for <hi>Toleration</hi> of Hereſies and ſins, they muſt not be <hi>tolerated.</hi> 6. I retort your Argument; for ſince God puniſhed his people grievouſly in thoſe fourty yeers in the Wilderneſſe, for their ſin; ſo ſhould men now be puniſhed for it. 7. And ſince <hi>Core, Dathan, Abiron,</hi> and their <hi>Adherents,</hi> for their Schiſms, and complaints againſt <hi>Authoritative Power,</hi> were puniſhed by death; ſo ſhould ſuch ſinners now a dayes be ſo puniſhed in like manner. 8. And ſince the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were not permitted to enter into the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which was a Type of the <hi>Chriſtian Church,</hi> no more ſhould Hereticks, Schiſmaticks, and other ſinners, have liberty to enter into the <hi>Chriſtian Church;</hi> for in ſo doing, we ſhould imitate God. 9. If this Argument hold, all Adulteries, Poligamies, Drunkenneſſe, Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony, Idolatry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> muſt be <hi>tolerated</hi> in the <hi>New Teſtament;</hi> ſince God <hi>tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated</hi> ſuch ſins, thoſe fourty yeers, in his people, when they were in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe: I am exceedingly aſhamed of you <hi>M.

               </p>
               <p>As for the firſt part of his Diſtinction: 1. It is not true, that <hi>Presbyteriall Diſcipline</hi> will ſtand in need of a <hi>Toleration;</hi> for what ever be concluded, it cannot ſtand in need of a <hi>Toleration,</hi> ſince it is already approved, as I have already ſhewed; unleſſe the <hi>Parliament</hi> and <hi>Aſſembly of Divines</hi> recall that precedent Approbation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Neither by a Reſolution, mean I a precipitated Reſolution to Aſſent, as you mean in the firſt part of your Diſtinction; nor a Reſolution to Aſſent, when ye are ſatisfied your ſelves, as you mean in the ſecond part; for God knoweth, what can, or will ſatisfie pertinacious men; but a Reſolution to Aſſent and Obey, after that ye have received ſufficient ſatisfaction Morally, by the <hi>Synod,</hi> in all their Concluſions and Determinations: I ſay Morally, for God alone, who hath created the ſoul of man, can ſatisfie its underſtanding, and will, Phyſically: And if ye Aſſent not to it, ye may be juſtly condemned, as Schiſmaticks, at leaſt: And if it were not ſo, no Judgement could be concluded in any Judicatory of this World, neither Eccleſiaſticall or Politicall; yea, not in the Independent Congregations themſelves: For he, that is to be condemned, will evermore ſay, That he is not ſatisfied with the Iudgement, if he hope to eſcape ſo.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>M.

               <p>
                  <hi>A.

               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> But I prove it: For the Parliament being reſolved, and having enjoyned the Aſſembly to ſeeke out, and give their Iudgements, what Diſcipline is moſt conforme unto Gods Word, which can be but one, and that we being all ſworn by <hi>Covenant</hi> to eſtabliſh and preſerve it, and to oppoſe all <hi>Hereſie</hi> and <hi>Schiſme,</hi> there is no doore open for more then one true Diſcipline: And ſo, this <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> being granted, I argue thus; ſuppoſing we cannot have any more but one Diſcipline, &amp;c. and that thereby <hi>Independents</hi> are not preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be Actors in any thing againſt their Conſciences, they neede not be Suitors for a <hi>Toleration:</hi> But the firſt is true, as appeareth by our <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> and the <hi>Ordinance</hi> of the <hi>Parliament. Ergo,</hi> The <hi>Connexion</hi> in the firſt Propoſition is evident; For, if they ſtand in need to be Suitors for any ſuch <hi>Toleration,</hi> they conſequently have neede to be Suitors for <hi>Perjury,</hi> and a breach of the <hi>Nationall Covenant,</hi> whereby we have all ſworn the contrary.</p>
               <p>But <hi>M. S.</hi> bringeth his Reaſon, wherefore they muſt be Suitors for ſuch a <hi>Toleration,</hi> againſt the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and the <hi>Parliaments Ordinance,</hi> viz. That ſo they may be Actors in good, according to their <hi>Conſciences.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> 1. So to be Suitors for a liberty, that they may perjure themſelves in breaking of their <hi>Covenant,</hi> and the <hi>Parliaments Ordinance,</hi> is to be Suitors for good. 2. <hi>M. S.</hi> here beggeth the queſtion, viz. That there is no good Diſcipline, but <hi>Independency;</hi> and whatſoever is, or ſhall be concluded, that yet the <hi>Independent</hi> way muſt hold, and they be Suitors for it. 3. We have proved heretofore, that it is not good, but very pernicious, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:124638:78"/>more dangerous then many <hi>Hereſies;</hi> yea then <hi>Lutheraniſme, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery</hi> or <hi>Arminianſme.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>M.S.</hi> addeth, <hi>It would be a greater honor to your Presbytery, then the contrary peremtoriouſneſſe is like to be, viz.</hi> To be Suitors for a <hi>Toleration</hi> of <hi>Independency.</hi>

                  <hi>M. S.</hi> The Apologiſts conceave, there is a neceſſity upon them, to ſave the Soules of others, as well as their own.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.S.</hi> 1. There is no neceſſity laid upon them to ſave Soules, by ſuch meanes as are not the way to ſave other mens Soules, but the ready way to damne their owne. 2. And is there no other way to ſave them, but by <hi>Independency?</hi> 3. If yee conceive ſo, then if other men conceive a neceſſity laid upon them to ſave ſoules, by ſuppreſſing of <hi>Independency,</hi> they muſt neceſſarily ſuppreſſe it: 4.

               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> 1. It is an untruth, that I undertake to ſecure them; I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take nothing, but tell a truth. 2. And if I lye, I pray <hi>M. S.</hi> to ſhew me, where ever the <hi>Parliament</hi> or <hi>Aſſembly</hi> hath preſſed them, to be Actors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Conſcience. 3. And yet, however I have no Authority to ſecure them, yet have I Reaſon ſufficient enough to prove it; For if their Conſciences be weake, or tender, the <hi>Parliament</hi> declareth, and hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared their care and reſolution, not to ſuffer weake or tender Conſciences to be wronged, or preſſed to be Actors againſt the Dictats thereof: And if yee cannot beleeve or truſt them, how can they, or ſhall they truſt you? 4. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is an ordinary Maxime amongſt Presbyterians, <hi>Not to perſecute men for their Conſciences,</hi> nor to accuſe them to the Civill Magiſtrate, unleſſe they be turbulent, and trouble the peace of the Church or State. As for your jeeres and injurious ſpeeches here againſt Presbyterians, we pardon Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi> temperament; for it is not Reaſon, nor the Man, but the Humour of the Man, that ſpeaketh.</p>
               <p>M. S. <hi>p.</hi> 93. bringeth his 3. Anſwer to the Antecedent, That this Promiſe is broken by A. S. ſeven times in his Diſcourſe, and by ſundry others of his Party.</p>
               <p>A. S. 1. The Antecedent of my Argument conteined no Promiſe, but a ſimple Enunciation; and therefore I could not break any Promiſe therein conteined; for, <hi>Non Entis nulla ſunt Accidentia;</hi> and what never was, could never be broken. 2. Put the caſe, it were a Promiſe made by me, How, or wherein

But to ſay, <hi>it is againſt your Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,</hi> is an old ſhift an hundred times made uſe of, and as oft anſwered. 5. We have never heard of any that threatned you, and therefore we cannot anſwer this accuſation. We know of ſundry extraordinary favours put upon you by this <hi>Parliament;</hi> but nothing of ſo many threatnings of miſeries a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you; unleſſe you account it your miſery, to receive good fat Benefices, and to be well paid for many Lectures up and down, by very many, whom it is well known, you ſcarce own for members of your Church; and ſo doe clip the wooll off the ſheeps backs, that are not of your flocks.</p>

               <p>M. S. reduceth this my Argument unto this Hypotheticall Propoſition, viz. <hi>If it be againſt the nature of the Communion of Saints, to live in Sects a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, without communicating at the Lords Table; then ought not the Apologiſts to be tolerated: But, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A.S. But M.S. is not ſo good an Analyſer of Arguments, as I took him to be: he faileth here, 1. in reducing it unto an Hypotheticall Propoſition, which poſeth nothing abſolutely, as this my Argument doth. 2. He maketh the Antecedent the Conſequent, and the Conſequent the Antecedent; for who ſeeth not, that in reducing of it to an Hypotheticall Propoſition, that muſt be the Antecedent, which is joyned with the Hypotheticall Conjunction <hi>(if)</hi> viz. <hi>If</hi> Toleration be granted: and that the Conſequent, that is inferred upon it, viz. <hi>It will be againſt the nature of the Communion of Saints.</hi> 3. But to help him, and to make him to ſee its face, I will reduce it into a Syllogiſme, which is ſuch:</p>
               <p>What is againſt the <hi>Communion of Saints,</hi> is not to be granted:</p>
               <p>But <hi>Toleration,</hi> viz. of <hi>Independencie,</hi> is againſt the <hi>Communion of Saints:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo, Toleration</hi> is not to be granted.</p>
               <p>The Major is certaine; neither will M.S. deny it.</p>
               <p>The Minor is proved thus:

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>M.S. anſwereth, denying the Minor of the ſecond Argument:</p>
               <p>But A. S. (ſaith he) doe you conceive, that men would, under <hi>Toleration,</hi> live without communicating at the Lords Table?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.S.</hi> But good Mr. <hi>M.S.</hi> 1. Howbeit they live not without communicating at the Lords Table abſolutely, in ſo far forth, as thoſe of one Congregation
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:124638:79"/>communicate, or may communicate together; yet live they without commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating at the Lords Table, <hi>ſecundum quid,</hi> in ſome reſpect, <hi>viz.</hi> in ſo far, as according to the Maximes of <hi>Independency,</hi> thoſe of one Congregation amongſt you, can have no right to communicate in another Congregation; much leſſe will ye admit the members of our Churches to communicate in yours, or ye your ſelves comunicate in ours, whom ye take up on you to reckon in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of your Siſter-Churches. Now we conceive, that according to Scripture, it is a part of the Communion of Saints, that all the members of the viſible Church here upon Earth, have right, in vertue of their ſpirituall fraternitie in Chriſt, to communicate one with another at the Lords Table, when occaſion is offered. It is not true, that the Communion at the Lords Table is all the breach of the Communion of Saints that <hi>Toleration</hi> breedeth, for it is alſo againſt the Communion in Diſcipline, and in Chriſtian Converſation, at leaſt, <hi>per ſe,</hi> or of it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>His 2. Anſwer is: If living in Sects apart be ſo offenſive (ſaith he) to your zeale over the Communion of Saints, why doe you not rather mediate a <hi>Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> for them, then oppoſe it?</p>
               <p>A.S. 1. My credit is but ſmall, as you confeſſe your ſelf. 2. Howbeit, were it as great, as it is ſmall, yet hope I, I ſhould never ſo far abuſe it, as to turne a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator for the ſetting up of Sects. 3. To your Quaere, I anſwer, It ſhould be wickedly done to mediate for the ſetting up of Sects; becauſe to mediate for it, were to mediate for the overthrow of the Communion of Saints.</p>
               <p>M. S. If you ſhall ſuffer them to work with you, they will be ſo much the more free to eat and drink with you.</p>
               <p>A.S. We are not ſo carefull for your eating and drinking, for ye may eat and drink with Epicures &amp; Pagans, as well as with us: but for your ſpirituall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, which cannot be maintained, if ye have a Toleration to be ſeparated from us, and one of you from another into particular Conventicles.</p>
               <p>A. S. <hi>Arg.</hi> 9. Becauſe the Scripture exhorts us evermore unto <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity;</hi> which cannot be eaſily procured by a Toleration of <hi>Sects;</hi> and cannot but beget new Schiſmes and Diviſions.</p>
               <p>M. S. denieth the Conſequence; and ſuppoſeth, that the force of my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon conſiſteth in this, viz. That if the Unitie, whereunto the Scripture exhorts us, cannot be procured by <hi>Toleration, Toleration</hi> is not to be granted.</p>
               <p>A. S. But he is deceived, or rather treacherouſly deceiveth others; for he ſhould have added the reſt, viz. <hi>Which cannot, &amp;c.</hi> for if it begets Sects and Schiſmes, it muſt deſtroy the unity of the Church. I ſay nothing to the Hyperbolicall praiſes he giveth to thoſe of his Sect; They will doubtleſly doe as much for him againe.</p>
               <p>M.S. perceiving this, Anſwereth, 2. That howbeit <hi>Toleration</hi> of <hi>Sects</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but beget new Schiſmes and Diviſions, yet it is to be granted; for many Sickneſſes are in the world, that come by <hi>eating</hi> &amp; <hi>drinking,</hi> yet are theſe to be tolerated.</p>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:124638:79"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> If <hi>Toleration, per ſe,</hi> begets them, it is not to be <hi>tolerated;</hi> for that, which is <hi>in ſe,</hi> and of its own nature, the cauſe of Evill, is evill; at leaſt, it is not to be <hi>tolerated</hi> poſitively, by Approbation, Conſent, &amp;c. for we muſt not approve Sin, or conſent thereunto; but we are bound to hinder it ſo far as in us lyeth. As for your <hi>Simile,</hi> it is altogether <hi>diſſimile;</hi> for Sickneſſes are not Sins, but Naturall Evils, which are not forbidden by Nature; neither hath God ever ſaid to man, <hi>Thou ſhalt not be ſick;</hi> as he ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill:</hi> Neither is it in our power, to avoyd Sickneſſe, as Sin: Neither is it <hi>eating</hi> or <hi>drinking,</hi> but too much, or too little <hi>eating</hi> or <hi>drinking,</hi> that maketh us ſick; and therefore they are alſo forbidden, and not to be tolerated or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M. S.</hi> 3. denieth, 1. that they plead for a <hi>toleration</hi> of any <hi>Sect:</hi> and 2. that they are a <hi>Sect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if a <hi>Sect</hi> be ſo called <hi>à ſecande,</hi> for cutting themſelves off from the true Churches Communion, as they have done, and as we have already demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, they muſt be a <hi>Sect,</hi> and conſequently plead for a <hi>Sect.</hi> I will not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to this <hi>M.S.</hi> his braggings; for I am only for to reſolve his Sophiſticati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: He doth well, not to compare the <hi>Apologiſme</hi> with <hi>A. S.</hi> which is <hi>Adam Steuart;</hi> but with <hi>Aſſiſme;</hi> for they are liker to the one, then to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M. S.</hi> 4. Whereas you ſay, that a <hi>toleration</hi> of <hi>Sects</hi> cannot but daily beget new Schiſmes, &amp;c. We anſwer, that Gods <hi>toleration</hi> or <hi>long-ſuffering</hi> towards ſinners, doth not only <hi>lead</hi> all ſinners <hi>to repentance,</hi> but alſo bring many there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto: And why ſhould not Mans <hi>toleration</hi> expect an effect anſwerable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> What ſhall I ſay to ſuch Impieties? 1. I deny the Conſequence. 2. And, if this be true, then if Gods <hi>toleration</hi> of Idolatrie, Inceſt, Sin againſt Nature, of Sacrilege, Wars, and all ſorts of violence and miſchiefe, bringeth men unto Repentance; wherefore ſhould not Mans <hi>toleration</hi> expect an anſwerable effect? 3. The reaſon wherefore it ſhould not expect an anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able effect, is, becauſe we have not received power of God to <hi>tolerate</hi> Crimes, nor have we it in our ſelves, as he hath it. 4. We are bound to hinder ſinne, ſo far forth as in us lieth. 5. He hath given a Law unto Men, not to <hi>tolerate,</hi> but to puniſh and hinder them. 6. If ſo, then <hi>M. S.</hi> and his <hi>Sect</hi> muſt <hi>toltrate</hi> Brothel-houſes, and all ſort of miſchiefe. 7. If Gods <hi>toleration</hi> bringeth ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to <hi>Repentance,</hi> is it not of it ſelfe, but by accident, in vertue of ſome Mercy and Grace annexed thereunto; which if we could give, as God can, we ſhould not be peradventure ſo much blamed, in <hi>tolerating</hi> of ſinne: but that can we not doe. 8. Neither doth God <hi>tolerate</hi> ſinnes poſitively by Law, Conſent, or Approbation thereof, ſuch as the <hi>Independents</hi> are Suiters for; but <hi>negatively,</hi> in not hindring of it Extraordinarily, in a way out of his ordinary Providence of Nature, or of Grace: <hi>Ergo,</hi> no more ſhould the State, Chriſtian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,

               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> 1. This <hi>Simile</hi> ſavoureth rather of good Wine, then of good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. 2. And the things compared are as like one to another, as <hi>M.

               <p>He addeth, That <hi>that meanes, of all others, that hath God in it, is likeſt to doe the deed.</hi> Is God then in this <hi>toleration</hi> of all ſorts of miſchiefe?

               <p>This <hi>M.

               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> My 10. Argument then in <hi>form</hi> will be this:</p>
               <p>If there were greater Differences amongſt the members of the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> in the time of S. <hi>Paul;</hi> and yet they Communicated together, yea, he exhorted them unto mutuall Communion, and forbearance of Sects and Diviſions: How much more ſhould <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents, viz.</hi> who have leſſe Difference among them, Communicate to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and be exhorted to mutuall Communion, and forbearance of Sects and Diviſions?</p>
               <p>But ſo it was, that there were greate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Differences amongſt the Members, &amp;c. <hi>Ergo,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M. S.</hi> Seemeth to deny the Propoſition, or the <hi>Connexum;</hi> and his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, or ſhould be, according to his diſcourſe, not becauſe my <hi>Argument,</hi> as he ſpeaketh, but becauſe the <hi>Connexum</hi> (as he pretends) <hi>is built upon a falſe foundation, viz. That the Reaſon why the Apologiſts refuſe Communion with you,</hi> (You meane I ſuppoſe in your <hi>Sacramentall</hi> Actions; adde, and in <hi>Government, &amp;c.</hi>) is becauſe of the degree of the differences in judgement between you and them; whereas the Reaſon of their refuſall in this kinde is the nature, or particularity of the difference, together with your practiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon your Opinion in oppoſition unto theirs, not the height, weight, or importance of either.</p>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:124638:81"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> But I prove my <hi>connexum;</hi> for the ground of non-Communion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, muſt either be difference of Iudgement, or a breach of Charity; for theſe are the two onely wayes, whereby Chriſtians are united unto their Head, and are one with another; the one in the <hi>underſtanding,</hi> the other in the <hi>will;</hi> the two principall Faculties of the Soul, wherein conſiſts the Image of God; ſo that the leſſe difference there is of Iudgement in the <hi>underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> or breach of Charity in the <hi>will,</hi> the leſſe <hi>reaſon</hi> is there for any Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, non-Communion, or Schiſm: So your Suppoſition is falſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That I ſuppoſe, that the ground of ſuch a refuſall of Communion conſiſteth onely in difference of Iudgement; for I ſuppoſe, that the ground of it may be a breach of Charity, and in particular perſons a vicious life.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>M. S.</hi> ſhould have done well to declare us here in particular, what is the nature, or particularity of this difference, betwixt us, and them; for we cannot <hi>in practicis</hi> diſpute accurately, upon Generalities, ſo abſtract from all Particularity.</p>
               <p>If it be replyed, That it is becauſe we admit vicious perſons unto our Communion; I have anſwered it in my <hi>Annotations,</hi> whereunto he pretends to anſwer. He ſhould have refuted my Reaſons here; as alſo ſundry others in Maſter <hi>Rutherfords</hi> Book, whereby he demonſtrates how ridiculous and frivolous this pretext is: Neither is it needfull, that I ſhould repeal them, to ſwell up a Book with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M. S.</hi> his ſecond Anſwer: If there were ſo many, and great <hi>differences amongſt the Members of the Church of Corinth,</hi> as you ſpeak of, and yet <hi>Paul</hi> no wayes perſwaded the Major part amongſt them, to caſt our, cut off, or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe, the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderling Parties,</hi> but exhorted them to mutuall Communion; why do not ye the like?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> We caſt you not out, nor off, but ye run away; we exhort you, but ye will not obey, ye ſlight, and contemn your Mother, that begot you; and when the Houſe of God is to be Reformed, ye will have all things according to your fancy, or ye will be gone and renounce your Mother: O what ſort of Children and Domeſticks of the Faith are ye?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M. S.</hi> his third Anſwer: He denyeth the <hi>Aſſumption, viz.</hi> That there was greater difference amongſt the Members of the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Independents, and our Churches.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> I prove it; for both they differed in Articles of <hi>Faith,</hi> ſome of them denying the <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> and <hi>Sacraments;</hi> ſome of them joyning the <hi>Law</hi> with the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> with <hi>Baptiſm:</hi> And in Charity, ſome crying up ſome <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Paſtors,</hi> and rejecting of others; others of the ſame Church, being of contrary mindes, and wills, without any Separation in Externall Communion, either in <hi>Sacraments</hi> or <hi>Government,</hi> for any thing we read in <hi>Scripture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> 11. Reaſon, in Subſtance is this, That the Opinion of our Brethren
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:124638:82"/>ſymbolizeth much, jumpeth in conceit, and that they ſympathize with the Donatiſts, who ſeparated themſelves from other Churches, under pretext, That they were not ſo holy as their own; neither is their Diſcipline unlike to that of the Convents, and Monaſteries amongſt the Papiſts, which profeſſe all one Doctrine, but are independent one upon another, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M. S.</hi> Anſwer 1. <hi>Symbolisa Theologia non eſt Argumentativa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> But this Argument is taken a <hi>Simili,</hi> and holds, <hi>quia ſimilium eadem eſt ratio, viz. In eo, in quo ſimilia ſunt;</hi> Now they are blamed in ſeparating themſelves from the reſt of thoſe, that profeſſe the ſame Doctrine, as if they were holier then the reſt: <hi>Ergo,</hi> ſo are the Independents to be blamed for the ſame Reaſon.</p>
               <p>His Inſtances are childiſh and fond; for Angels and Devils agree not in that, which is blameable in Devils, for that agreement ſhould be an impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, both to their Holineſſe, and Happineſſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Neither agreeth <hi>A. S.</hi> with <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> in making way to any Hereſie of his own, as <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> wherein he was blameable.</p>
               <p n="3">3. No more is it to the purpoſe, that ye are not like to Monks, for their Paunches, idleneſſe, or in their Buildings; howbeit, ſome of them be as lean, and as buſie, in their own way, as any <hi>of you</hi> Independents can be in yours: Neither is it a ſin, to be fat. Onely I compare you with them, in that wherein we all blame them, <hi>viz.</hi> In ſeparating themſelves from others, under pretext of greater holineſſe.</p>
               <p>To his Anſwer, to the third point: I reply, That I make not this compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon betwixt the Donatiſts, and the Apologiſts, (as <hi>M. S.</hi> ſayeth here) but betwixt them, and all thoſe that are of the Independents opinion.</p>
               <p>And ſo to his firſt Anſwer, I reply, That however ſome of the Apologiſts (of whom alone I ſpeak not) have not Churches, yet have they the ſame opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, concerning the Separation of their Churches from others, that profeſſe the ſame Doctrine, and that under pretext, that they are holier then the reſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>M. S.</hi> anſwereth, That neither in ſubſtance, nor truth, doth it touch any of them, or their opinion. 1. For they do not ſeparate from other Churches, but onely in ſuch opinions and practiſes, wherein they cannot get leave of their Conſciences to joyn with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> I have proved, that it touches them in truth; and as for his proof the Donatiſts did juſt ſo.</p>
               <p>Whereas <hi>M. S.</hi> ſaith, That they of the Presbytery differ in Opinions and practiſes one from another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.S.</hi> 1. It is true; but that is in things, that are not very materiall. 2. Or if they be materiall, they are particular Opinions of particular men, that are not known; not of whole Churches, nor approved by whole Churches. 3. And howbeit, ſome of them, though very few, differ in ſome practiſes, which are
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:124638:82"/>not materiall; yet is it not ſo much they, that make theſe differences; as that they are compelled by others to ſuffer them, as they have declared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their Letters ſent to the Aſſembly. 4. That ſmall difference breeds no Schiſm or Sects among them; but they entertain mutuall communion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, both in Sacrament, and Government; and they admit one another unto their Synodall and Sacramentall Communion: ſo do not Independent Churches amongſt themſelves, nor with ours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M. S.</hi> 2. Argument for this his Aſſertion is, becauſe <hi>A. S.</hi> himſelf and his Party, do ſeparate themſelves from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe they think not that Church to be ſo holy, as their own.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> 1. We ſeparate not our ſelves from the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, becauſe of greater, or leſſe holineſſe in our Church, or in particular Perſons, then in theirs; but becauſe we conceive that the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church erreth in Fundamentalls. 2. Not onely committeth, but alſo, 3. Teaches Idolatry, and 4. compelleth men againſt their Conſcience, to commit, and profeſſe it: 5. Neither did we ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from the Papiſts, but they ſeparated from us, and did caſt us out of their Church, and perſecuted us to death; ſo that neither, could we entertain Communion with them, without looſing both body and ſoul. 6. Neither yet ſeparate we from any Church, that holds the ſame <hi>Doctrine</hi> with us. 7. Neither beleeve we, that any Church holding the ſame <hi>Doctrine</hi> with us, can morally fall into Idolatry, or urge us to be Actors againſt our Conſciences in any Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Act; And this Liberty of Conſcience Independents may have in our Churches. 8. We pray you alſo to declare unto us, what Hereſie, Idolatry, or great vice, you ſee taught or approved of amongſt us, that ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell you to quit our Churches, as we found amongſt the Papiſts, and then your Argument will have ſome force; otherwayes it hath none at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M. S.</hi> 3. Reaſon. If they do not think their Presbyteriall Churches <hi>more holy</hi> then the Congregationall, they are far more guilty of Schiſm then their Brethren, <hi>i. e.</hi> then Independents; For then they are at liberty in point of Conſcience, to come over and joyn with them, whereas the other are in bands and fetters of Conſcience, and can paſſe unto them. Their Brethren would come to them, but cannot; they can come over unto theſe, but will not. It is the Will, and not the Act, that maketh Schiſm and Separation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> 1. But if they think not their Presbyteriall Churches more holy, all your Argument is ridiculous. 2. And I muſt confeſſe, that <hi>M. S.</hi> with his Faction are very ſlight, who can make very few Arguments, that have any appearance of reaſon, unleſſe they be grounded upon their pretended holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; and that this be ſuppoſed as a Principle of Independent Divinity: What <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith of <hi>Preſumptuous Scholars, Multi ad ſapientiam perveniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent niſi ſe jam jam perveniſſe putaſſent,</hi> may be more juſtly ſaid of your ridiculous Sect, changing onely <hi>ſapientiam, in veram pietatem aut vitae ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>iatem.</hi> 3. Howbeit, ye were holier then we, yet could we not come unto
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:124638:83"/>you; and that not ſo much becauſe ye are not holy, as becauſe we finde in your Opinions a great folly, yea, by conſequence more Impiety and Hereſie, then in ſundry Hereticall Churches, as we, and many others alſo have elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where ſhewed: 4. But can you think, that to pleaſure every Melancholious brain, that differs not from us in Doctrine, (if he be leſſe vicious then others, howbeit no wayes more vertuous) but onely in opinion concerning Diſcipline; in caſe, that under pretext of Conſcience, he will not ſubmit unto our Churches, that preſently all our Churches muſt ſubmit unto him? Or were it not better that he, and all his, ſhould be ſent into <hi>America,</hi> a while, till their brains may be brought to better temper. We cannot be ſo fooliſh, as to come unto ſo inconſiderable a Party; whoſe opinions too, are yet unknown: And of thoſe, that are known, ſome more dangerous, then many Hereſies. 5. What ſhould we have to do with men, who plead on this manner for impunity for all ſin and Hereſie; ſhould we admit into our Churches an Anarchy; and give power to ignorant Fellows, to Preach, and make Miniſters; ſhall we grant unto women the ſhingling, or gingling of the Keyes of the Church, to ſerve my ſelf with the trim, and fine termes of Independent Divinity? 6. It is a ſilly affected diſtinction of <hi>M. S.</hi> to ſay, that it is the Will, and not the Act, that maketh a Schiſm: It is both; for Schiſm is an Act of the Will, or a voluntary Act; It muſt be <hi>Actus Voluntatis elicitus, aut imperatus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M.S.</hi> 4. <hi>Anſwer,</hi> That he ſeeth not wherein the Apologiſts ſymbolize with Convents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> I have ſhewn it, 1. In their Separation from others, under pretext of greater Holineſſe, then other men have. 2. And becauſe every Order is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent one of another, juſt as your Congregationall Churches, the Members whereof have no more Communion with Churches amongſt us, or amongſt themſelves, then the Monks of one Convent, with thoſe of another Convent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M. S.</hi> 5. You couple your ſelf with theſe Popiſh Convents, implying that your Presbyterians have their Soveraign Judicatory, as they.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> We have no ſupreme Iudicatory, but that of the living God: If we have Superiour, and Inferiour Iudicatories, and the Papiſts alſo; neither we, nor they, preciſely are to be blamed in that; but ſo far forth, as they have the Pope, one man, for ſupreme Iudge, and Head of the Church, which is proper to Chriſt; In that they prove, that he is the Antichriſt. And as it is great pride, in them, to make him with his Conſiſtory ſupreme Iudge over the Univerſall Church: So is it a peece of extraordinary pride, and ſelf-wit in your Churches, that ye conſtitute ſometimes ſeven or eight ſimple Fellows, how Hereticall ſoever be their Doctrine, and how abominable ſoever their life, ſupreme Iudges, Gods immediate Lievtenants, and Independent of all the Iudgements of all the Churches of the World, how Orthodox ſoever be their Opinions, and how pious and holy ſoever be their Practiſes. But againſt
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:124638:83"/>ſuch a Subordination of Eccleſiaſticall Iudicatories, as we have according to Gods Word, no man can take juſt Exception.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M. S.</hi> ſaith, That he hath anſwered my twelfth Reaſon; and I have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, how Abſurdly he hath anſwered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> 13. Argument. <hi>M. S.</hi> with his Logico Divinity, by a Doctorall pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, under pretext to reform my Argument, deformeth and disfigureth it altogether by his Additions, and Confuſions, in making it Hypotheticall, whereas it is meerly Categoricall: If he had deſired to put it in Form, he needed not, but to have added, or expreſſed the Propoſition, which was onely ſuppreſſed in this manner.</p>
               <p>They who have but one God, one Chriſt, one Lord, and one Spirit, who are one Body, who have one Faith, and one Baptiſm, whereby they enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church, ſhould have one Communion, whereby to be Spiritually fed, and one Diſcipline to be ruled by.</p>
               <p>But we all, <hi>i. e.</hi> Presbyterians (as ye call us) and Independents, we have but one God, one Chriſt, one Lord, and one Spirit, <hi>&amp;c. Ergo,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We all, <hi>i. e.</hi> Presbyterians, and Independents, ſhould have but one Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Communion, whereby to be Spiritually fed, and one Diſcipline to be ruled by.</p>
               <p>And from this, he inferreth very well. <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Independents are not to be <hi>tolerated, viz.</hi> In their Schiſm, Separation, or non-Communion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M. S.</hi> grants all the Argument, and afterward diſtinguiſhes the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, which is an odde manner of anſwering of Arguments, and proper to his Sect: But we muſt take of ill pay-maſters, what we may. He ſaith then 1. My Concluſions do not follow from my Premiſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> But the Argument is in Form: If it follow not, ſhew me, what fault there is in the Form of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M. S.</hi> 2. jeereth the termes of my Argument in calling them, one, one, and one, and my multiplied unity, and ſo jeereth the Holy Ghoſt himſelf, from whom I have borrowed them, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. and 8. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. I might have added more unities; as that we ſhould with one mouth glorifie God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.6. we are one Bread, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.17. we drink in one Spirit, <hi>verſ.</hi> 13. we are all one in Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.28. one Law-giver and Iudge, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.12. Chriſt prayeth, that we may be all one anomgſt our ſelves, and one in the Father, and the Son, <hi>John</hi> 17.22, 23.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M. S.</hi> his firſt Solution then is, That we ought all to have one Communion and Diſcipline, but not that, that is of Claſſique Inſpiration, no more then that of Papall, or Epiſcopall Recommendation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> 1. At leaſt of this, <hi>viz. We ſhould have one Communion and Diſcipline;</hi> it follows, That there ſhould be no Schiſm or Toleration granted, that may make a Schiſm in the body, and diſſolve our Communion. 2. If you cannot ſhew any materiall difference in <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and other things, (yea, ye confeſſe
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:124638:84"/>your ſelves, that it is not great) ye cannot ſeparate your ſelves from us in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall Communion and Diſcipline. 3. Neither hitherto have ye ſhewn any practiſe in Sacramentall Communion, wherein ye differ from us; for we have no Idolatry among us, and men openly vicious, are not admitted to the Lords Table among us: Neither can any particular man abſtain from Sacramentall Communion in a Church, upon pretext that this or that man is vicious; for it belongeth not to him, but to the Rulers of the Church to judge of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar mens lives, whether they be in a State to Communicate, or not: No more appertains it to one particular Church, to judge of the Members of another particular Church: Wherefore, that not being their Act, it cannot be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to them; and conſequently, they have no Reaſon in ſuch a Caſe, to be ſo ſcrupulous.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M. S.</hi> his ſecond Anſwer is, Howbeit they be bound to one Communion and Diſcipline; yet would they be led to it, by light, and not by fear.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> 1. There is light enough ſhewn you, if ye wil! open your eyes to ſee it. And we deſire you not to joyn in this Unity, out of any fear of men, but of God. 2. Howbeit, you cannot ſee the Light, yet no Approbation, Conſent, or Poſitive Permiſſion, or Toleration, ſhould be granted you to live in Darkneſſe, much leſſe to erect Schools and Synagogues of Darkneſſe. 3. The Parliament, and all good men, I am confident, will <hi>tolerate</hi> you in your Darkneſſe, till <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> enlighten you, if ye can be content to live in qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of private men, and not erect Churches and Schools, to blinde others: Neither can they grant you any thing more; for howſoever, they cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell your Conſciences, yet maſt they hinder you, to undo other mens Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences in ſowing of your Tares, and wilde Oats.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M. S.</hi> 3. Anſwer: That duty which lieth upon all <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> to have but <hi>one Communion and Diſcipline among them,</hi> is no Diſpenſation unto any Party or number of them, to ſmite their Brethren with the fiſt of uncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or to diſmount them from their Miniſteriall ſtandings in the <hi>Church,</hi> becauſe they will not, or rather cannot, knit and joyn in the ſame <hi>Communion</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline</hi> with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> 1. You are very ingrate, unthankfull unto the Parliament, and your Brethren of the <hi>Aſſembly:</hi> Ye have experimented no uncharitableneſſe from any of them: Hitherto they have dealt with you in all meekneſſe, and brotherly affection. 2. None of you have been put out of your Miniſtery, for your Opinions; howbeit, many of you have merited it, for your inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, and malepertneſſe, in erecting of new <hi>Churches</hi> and <hi>Sects,</hi> againſt your own <hi>Tenets;</hi> for ye maintain, that a <hi>Church</hi> cannot be erected without the Magiſtrates Conſent, and the Right hand of Aſſociation of <hi>Neighbour Churches,</hi> which ye have not had in your <hi>Churches,</hi> here in <hi>Old England.</hi> 3. But where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may not Sectaries be diſmounted, who mount ſo high at their own hand. 4. If ye will not joyn with the reſt the <hi>Churches</hi> of this Kingdom, and
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:124638:84"/>ſubmit to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and the <hi>Church of God</hi> here; but be <hi>Eus per ſe, Ens independens,</hi> and have particular Priviledges beyond the reſt of the Subjects; ye may be gone, and ſtay there from whence ye came; ye may goe to <hi>New-England,</hi> and mount as high as pleaſeth you, there; Only trouble not the Church and Kingdome here, and the Church and Kingdome will not trouble you there. 4. The <hi>Church</hi> here doth you no wrong; only ſhe mainteineth, that your Tenets are contrary to Gods Word: and confeſſeth, That if the <hi>Parliament</hi> will tolerate you, it may; but that, in ſo doing, their Iudgement is (ſince they are commanded to give it) that it is flatly againſt Gods Word. And I may ſay, ſuch a thing might breed ill blood, of Friends make Enemies, and peradventure undoe the State: and who knoweth, if it ſhould pleaſe God in his mercy to end this War, but it might make a Sacrifice of all ſuch as ſhould have hand in it: All Chriſtians are bound in Conſcience to oppoſe ſuch Licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and Libertiniſme in Religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M. S.</hi> his 4. <hi>Anſwer</hi> is, that thoſe of his Sect are kept under Hatches and oppreſſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> Unto this we have anſwered, and in this they do as Children that weepe, before they be whipt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> 14. If viſible <hi>Churches</hi> have <hi>Diſciplines</hi> or <hi>Government,</hi> different in their Species, then the <hi>Churches</hi> muſt be different in their Species alſo. But the conſequent is falſe. <hi>Ergo,</hi> So is the Antecedent; <hi>So Churches</hi> have not different Diſciplines and <hi>Governments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Connexion</hi> in my <hi>Argument</hi> is proved, becauſe all <hi>collective Bodies,</hi> that are governed, are differenced in their Species by their ſpecificall <hi>Governments,</hi> as we ſee in Civill <hi>Government,</hi> in the <hi>Conſtitution</hi> of <hi>States, Kingdoms,</hi> and <hi>Republicks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Aſſumption</hi> is proved, becauſe the <hi>viſible Church</hi> is but one <hi>Church</hi> in its Species.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M.S.</hi> jeeres, jeaſts, and flouts this <hi>Argument:</hi> he makes as though he helpt it; but it is ſtrong enough without his help, the matter being ſound e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and the Syllogiſme in forme.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M. S.</hi> His firſt <hi>Anſwer</hi> is, that from hence cannot be gathered, that the Apologiſme is not <hi>tolerable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> This is not the <hi>Concluſion,</hi> that I have to prove; for I never reade in Scripture, or elſe where, of any <hi>Eccleſiaſticall Diſcipline,</hi> or <hi>Government,</hi> named <hi>Apologiſme:</hi> Away then with your new coyned tearmes of <hi>Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſme,</hi> and <hi>Quinque Eccleſian Miniſters, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Concluſion,</hi> that I have to prove, is this; <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and your <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Churches</hi> have not, according to Gods word, or ſhould not have dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent <hi>Diſciplines,</hi> which any <hi>Neophyt</hi> in <hi>Logick</hi> can eaſily deduce by the power of <hi>Syllogiſmes:</hi> For it is known in <hi>Logick,</hi> that a <hi>Syllogiſme,</hi> that can inferre an <hi>univerſall Concluſion,</hi> may inferre all the particulars of that <hi>univerſall
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:124638:85"/>Concluſion,</hi> as when I conclude, that all men have reaſonable ſoules, I conclude that <hi>Peter, Paul,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> have reaſonable ſoules; ſo then when I conclude here <hi>univerſally,</hi> that no <hi>Church</hi> hath or ſhould have different <hi>Diſciplines, Ergo, Presbyterians, Independents,</hi> and other <hi>Churches,</hi> ſhould not have different <hi>Diſciplines</hi> or <hi>Government;</hi> I conclude, there muſt be but one <hi>Church,</hi> and one <hi>Government,</hi> what ever it be.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Lord</hi> be <hi>God,</hi> then follow him; But if <hi>Baal,</hi> then follow him: So if <hi>Presbyterian Diſcipline</hi> or <hi>Government</hi> be <hi>Gods,</hi> follow it; if <hi>Independents Diſcipline</hi> be <hi>Gods,</hi> follow it, and no other: Let not the Child be devided in two, as the falſe Mother, that had ſtolen the Child, would have had it, but let it live, as the true Mother deſired.</p>
               <p>No more <hi>Pluralities</hi> (I pray) of <hi>Diſciplines,</hi> then of <hi>Benefices;</hi> Let no man bargain about <hi>Government;</hi> Let <hi>Gods Ordinance</hi> hold, what ever it be; and whereever <hi>Independent Government</hi> be, whether in <hi>Aries, Taurus, Cancer,</hi> or <hi>Capricorne,</hi> ye may goe there, and enjoy it peaceably: We only ſpeak of the Diſcipline of Chriſts Church in <hi>England,</hi> what it ſhould be.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M. S.</hi> It followeth not from hence, that therefore that Government, which is more generally eſtabliſhed and practiſed in the World, ſhould be that ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cificall Government, whereby it ought to be governed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> Neither intended I to inferre or conclude any ſuch thing: Only I ſay, that whatever the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> conclude, or the <hi>Parliament</hi> eſtabliſh in the State, yet, according to Gods Word, Pluralitie of Eccleſiaſticall Diſciplines or Governments can no wayes be concluded or eſtabliſhed; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, ye goe againſt Gods Word, in pleading for it: And therefore all is loſt that you build thereupon. I cannot better anſwer your comparing of me with <hi>Herod,</hi> then to ſlight it, with the reſt of the overflowings of your Call. One good Argument would help your Cauſe, more then a hundred In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries: Is this the Independent Power of Pietie you talk ſo much of?</p>
               <p>Unto <hi>M. S.</hi> his 2. Anſwer; I grant him, That before he and his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues be ſufficiently informed of the lawfulneſſe of any Government, that in Gods mercy, ſhall be eſtabliſhed, they are not bound to obey, much leſſe ought they to be ſcourged, as he ſpeaketh. But when they are ſufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the lawfulneſſe of it, (I meane <hi>ſufficientiâ morali,</hi> which is all that Men can furniſh them; but not <hi>Phyſicâ,</hi> which is only in Gods hands) they muſt obey, and no wayes plead, with all Hereticks and Schiſmaticks, <hi>non-Conviction,</hi> and pretended <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and <hi>Toleration,</hi> and want of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the <hi>Civill Magiſtrate</hi> to puniſh them: They muſt obey, as well as the falſe Prophets, and Schiſmaticks of the Old Teſtament.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M.S.</hi> 3. <hi>Anſw.</hi> The ſervants of Chriſt ſhould not fall foule for uniformitie in <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> and the greater eat up the leſſe: God hath provided other meanes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> If divers <hi>Diſciplines</hi> be eſtabliſhed by Law, the good Miniſters muſt
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:124638:85"/>tolerate that, which they cannot mend; and ſerve themſelves of all the means they can, according to Gods Word, to reduce their Brethren to the right way: But if they be not yet eſtabliſhed, none, but one, ſhould be approved by the ſervants of God; and the Civill Magiſtrate, in imitation of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or rather of God, is bound in duty, only to admit one, and that the moſt conform to Scripture; unleſſe he will bring in Factions and Schiſmes both into Church and Commonwealth: and that principally, when any of them may be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous for both, as <hi>Independencie,</hi> which may prove more dangerous then ſeven Hereſies.</p>
               <p>But in all this, M.S. anſwereth not my Argument formally, but moſt ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly grants the Premiſſes, and denieth the Concluſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> 15. Neither Chriſt, nor his Apoſtles, ever granted any <hi>Toleration</hi> to divers Sects and Governments in the Church; Wherefore then will ye be Suiters for that, which they never granted?</p>
               <p>M. S. here neither denieth the Antecedent, nor the Conſequence of this my Argument; but ſingeth his old ſong, That neither <hi>Chriſt, nor his Apoſtles, did ever grant a power to a major part of Profoſſours in a Kingdom or Nation, to grind the faces of their Brethren,</hi> either becauſe they could not conform their Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with them, or becauſe they kept a good Conſcience.</p>
               <p>A. S. 1. We grant you all that. 2. Neither are your <hi>faces grinded.</hi> 3. Much leſſe <hi>grinded</hi> for non-conformitie of your Judgements with theirs, or keeping of a good Conſcience. 4. Your Conſcience is very ill, that will not be infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the Truth. 5. We have told you, that Anabaptiſts, Separatiſts, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, like unto you, pretend the ſame thing. 6. Ye furniſh us here an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt <hi>New-England</hi> men, in their proceedings with Godly Miniſters here. 7. Live quietly, and trouble not the Church, nor the State, and ye may live here a peaceable life, without any trouble to your Conſciences. 8. But it is a foolery in you, to think, that your <hi>faces are grinded;</hi> becauſe your Brethren will not conſent, that ye erect a Sect, &amp; have Pulpits allowed you to beat down the Truth: They are bound in Conſcience to reſiſt you, as ye take your ſelves bound to reſiſt them. 9. If you think your <hi>faces grinded</hi> here, you may be gone, and live in contentment there, from whence ye came. 10. And yet, howbeit your Brethren of the Miniſteris take not upon themſelves any thing, but to reſiſt you with the Arms of the Spirit; yet muſt you thinke, that the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill Magiſtrate hath no leſſe power over you here, then your Civill Magiſtrate hath over Sectaries in <hi>New-England.</hi> 11. But it were better for you, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, to take a reſolution to live with us in unitie, under ſuch a Diſcipline, as may be concluded and ſetled in the feare of God. But cannot you live in this World, unleſſe you give a Law to all the World?

               <p>
                  <hi>M.S.</hi> 2. anſwers my Argument with a Queſtion, <hi>Whence we have a Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of our Presbyterian Diſcipline?</hi>

                  <hi>A. S.</hi> 1. It is a Maxime in Philoſophie, that <hi>Queſtio queſtionem non ſolvit,</hi> one Queſtion ſolves not another. 2. I anſwer, That we have its inſtitution from God, in his Word, as we have already demonſtrated it: and He, in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting of it, hath ordained, that it be not only tolerated, but alſo received and preached through all the World, as I have already proved. 3. In <hi>France</hi> it was brought in by Chriſts Miniſters, eſtabliſhed by a Proteſtant King, and ſome others before him, who had ſome taſte of the Goſpel. 4. It hath been there eſtabliſhed by the Law of the Kingdome, and the Proteſtant Armies, which God bleſſed under a Proteſtant King, againſt the Pope, the Papiſts and Jeſuites, who would have pulled the Crown off his head, to ſet it upon <hi>Don Philips;</hi> that ſo fighting for his Crown, he might alſo fight for that of Chriſt Ieſus, and eſtabliſh it gloriouſly in his Kingdome. And all this may be eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the <hi>French Hiſtory,</hi> and ſundry Edicts in favour of Proteſtants. It is an untruth, that ever it was tolerated by the Romiſh Church; for they imployed all their endeavours to oppreſſe it, yea againſt all Law: They are bound to their King, who is alſo bound to them, for fighting for his Cauſe. In <hi>England</hi> it is eſtabliſhed (as I have ſundry times told you) in the <hi>French, Dutch, Italian,</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh Churches,</hi> by the <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments</hi> Authority. And how it hath been eſtabliſhed in <hi>Scotland,</hi> it is better known, then I can declare it, <hi>viz.</hi> by Civill and Eccleſiaſticall Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
               <p>M. S. his 3. Anſwer or Objection againſt my <hi>Reaſon,</hi> commeth to this; That by the ſame Reaſon, Papiſts will not tolerate Proteſtants, whom they hold for Schiſmaticks.</p>
               <p>A.S. 1. This is only ſaid, but not proved. 2. They neither tolerate Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, nor Schiſmaticks, when they can hinder them. 3. The Papiſts hold not us ſimply for Schiſmaticks, but alſo for Hereticks. 4. And conſequently, if your Argument hold, That we muſt tolerate whatſoever they tolerate; ſince they tolerate us in quality of Hereticks, in their judgement, we muſt alſo tolerate Hereticks, yea Iewes alſo, and permit them Synagogues, as they doe; yea, we muſt tolerate an hundred Religions, as the States of <hi>Poland</hi> doe. 5. The queſtion is not, what Papiſts will, but what both we, and they ſhould doe; or rather what Gods Word commands us to doe: We take not Antichriſt, but Chriſt and his Word for a patterne of our duty.</p>
               <p>M.S. his 4. Anſw. Whereas you ſay, that they granted not a <hi>Toleration</hi> to divers Sects, doe you not imply, that they did grant a <hi>Toleration</hi> to ſome one Sect, at leaſt: And how know you, whether the <hi>Apologiſme</hi> be not that Sect?</p>
               <p>A.S. Truly M.S. is very ſubtile, who of a Negative infers an Affirmative; even as if I ſhould conclude thus: M. S. is not divers Schiſmaticks or Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks; <hi>Ergo,</hi> He is one Heretick: This man hath not committed divers Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries;
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:124638:86"/>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> He hath committed one Adultery. Have you never learned, good M.S. that old Rhime, wherein there is more Reaſon then Poetrie:
<q>
                     <l>Syllogiſari, non eſt ex Particulari;</l>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>ſince it follows not. I know not at all, that Chriſt or his Apoſtles ever granted a <hi>Toleration</hi> to the Sect of <hi>Apologiſme,</hi> as you ſtile it. 3. And ſince you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale to my Conſcience in this Point, you muſt ſubmit to my Iudgement; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe you profane the Name of God.</p>
               <p>M. S. 5. Anſwer is, That <hi>Toleration</hi> is <hi>rei malae;</hi> and therefore the <hi>Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſts</hi> ſhould not be Suiters for a <hi>Toleration,</hi> but ſhould be encouraged.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.S. M.S.</hi> is minded to be merry, but I muſt be ſerious; and therefore 1. I deny your Antecedent, and I gave you the Reaſon heretofore. 2. <hi>Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſme,</hi> I have told you, is <hi>res peſſima,</hi> and more dangerous by conſequence, then 10. Hereſies, as I have ſufficiently proved to all men who will ſit down with Reaſon.</p>
               <p>Then he addeth, That if they ſin in ſuing for a <hi>Toleration; Ergo,</hi> To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent that ſin, it ſhould be granted them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> By the ſame reaſon, if a man ſin in ſuing for a <hi>toleration</hi> of <hi>Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taniſme</hi> or <hi>Adultery;</hi> to the end to prevent ſuch ſins, they ſhould be <hi>tolerated.</hi> This Argument of <hi>M.S.</hi> is as ridiculous, as impious.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M. S.</hi> But ſixthly and laſtly, What doe you think of <hi>Sinite utrumque creſcere; Let both grow together untill the Harveſt,</hi> Math. 13.30.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.S.</hi> Since you are ſo deſirous of my judgement, I ſhall willingly give it you. 1. I anſwer by your own Maxime, that <hi>Symbolica Theologia non eſt argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentativa;</hi> Symbolicall or Parabolicall Theologie furniſheth no good Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. Now this is a <hi>Parable;</hi> for the Text ſaith, v. 3. <hi>And he ſpake many things to them in Parables<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> 2. I beleeve, that by both, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Wheat</hi> and the <hi>Tares,</hi> our Saviour meaneth not Hereticks, but all the Good, or the Faithfull, and the Wicked; ſo that, if out of this you will conclude a <hi>Toleration,</hi> ye muſt conclude a <hi>Toleration</hi> for Adulterers, Murtherers, Parricides, <hi>Ravilliacks,</hi> and Gunpowder Traitors, <hi>Chatells,</hi> Regi-cides. 3. If by a Toleration, ye mean a poſitive Toleration or Conſent, ſuch as ye deſire; then we muſt all poſitively tolerate, or conſent, to have men of ſuch ill qualities and ill conditions, to live amongſt us with all impunity, yea, and approbation. 4. I beleeve, that Chriſt ſpeaketh there to the Apoſtles, and will not that they uſurpe the Civill Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates power, in puniſhing of them that are of his cognizince, yea, though he will not doe it. And ſo doe our learned and godly Miniſters; they doe their duty with the ſword of the Spirit, and leave the Materiall ſword unto the Civill Magiſtrate, as proper unto him, as the Spirituall is unto them, for <hi>He caries not the ſword in vain.</hi> Neither muſt they meddle with the Materiall, nor he with the Spirituall ſword. 5. If they muſt be <hi>tolerated,</hi> according to Gods Word, how have you taken the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and ſo ſolemnly ſworne, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:124638:87"/>with your hands, the extirpation of Papiſts and of all the <hi>Hierarchy?</hi> 6. <hi>Servet</hi> (who called the <hi>Trinity</hi> a three-headed <hi>Cat,</hi> and denyed the <hi>Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> of the Son of God, and his Mediator-ſhip) and his Followers brought this very Argument for him and his Sect, that you now do. So here ye bring no new thing, but what ſundry <hi>Hereticks</hi> brought before you; ſo yee tread directly in their ſteps, and have made choice of a prety pattern.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> 16. Argument is taken from the practiſe of the Independents of <hi>New England; whoſe wayes and practiſes</hi> (ſay they) <hi>are improved to a better edition, and greater refinement,</hi> whom alſo they compare in their Apology with Father <hi>Abraham,</hi> and being put in form, will be this.</p>
               <p>That courteſie, which no man can obtain of the Independents, where they have authority, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>New England;</hi> That courteſie ſhould they not be ſuiters for here in <hi>Old England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But a Toleration of a New <hi>Religion,</hi> or <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> of <hi>Sects</hi> and <hi>Hereſies,</hi> is a courteſie, that no man can obtain of the Independents, where they have authority, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>New England. Ergo,</hi> Toleration is a courteſie, that they <hi>i. e.</hi> Independents ſhould not be ſuiters for here in <hi>Old England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Major Propoſition may be confirmed; for it is <hi>à pari;</hi> and ſuch meaſure as they meaſure with, ſuch ſhould be meaſured unto them again, for the <hi>Lex Talionis</hi> requireth it: And what reaſon is it, that men ſhould be <hi>tolerated</hi> by us in their erroneous Tenets, who will not <hi>tolerate</hi> the truth? What if they ſhould increaſe here? What more favour could we hope for from them, then our dear Brethren have taſted already in the ſorrowfull times of their Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions? Without doubt, being great Politicians, and Undertakers, zealous in the Noviciate and Infaney of their <hi>Sect,</hi> and no leſſe cunning, and politique, then the Ieſuites themſelves, the Church of God, and the State alſo ſhould ſeriouſly lay to heart, what they may do here likewiſe; And their activity in making of Proſelytes, both in the Army, and the City, ſhould give all men ſubject enough to be diffident of them.</p>
               <p>The Minor appeareth cleerly, by the proceedings of <hi>New England,</hi> and the <hi>Sectaries</hi> bred in the <hi>Independent Sect,</hi> whereof ſome women have been the Ring-leaders, as one Miſtreſſe <hi>Hutchinſon,</hi> and ſundry others, whom they would no wayes <hi>tolerate</hi> amongſt them, but puniſhed by Impriſonment, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iling of their perſons, howſoever they went out of <hi>Old England</hi> with them and were Companions of the ſame miſery, pretended Perſecution and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking.</p>
               <p>No better dealt they with ſome <hi>Presbyterians</hi> of <hi>Old England,</hi> who being grievouſly perſecuted here for <hi>Non-Conformity;</hi> yet would they not ſo much a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>tolerate</hi> them in any corner of the Country; yea not ſo much as in that, which was next to the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> where they could not, but conſequently be expoſed to the greateſt danger; ſuch were their mercies and bowels of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion towards their poore, and afflicted <hi>Brethren,</hi> whom yet they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:124638:87"/>to be of very ſound Doctrine, and holineſſe of life.</p>
               <p>As for this Argument, <hi>M. S.</hi> becauſe he cannot anſwer the Minor, he ſends me to <hi>New England</hi> to ſeeke the Solution.</p>
               <p>But I purpoſe not to undertake ſuch a voyage for <hi>Independent Sophiſticati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> ſince the Argument convicts my underſtanding.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M. S.</hi> 2. <hi>Anſwereth,</hi> That he would fain know, what I meane to do with this Story.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> Since he pretends ſo great dulneſſe, I have put the <hi>Argument</hi> in Forme for him, and ſhewed him, how I ſerve my ſelfe of it, to confirme my Minor by.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M. S.</hi> proveth, that this Story cannot ſerve me, for, ſaith he, <hi>i. e. A. S. doth not approve of thoſe proceedings, viz.</hi> of the <hi>Independents</hi> of <hi>N. E.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> It is all one, for I argue onely <hi>ex Conceſſis,</hi> which maketh it an <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ad hominem,</hi> and ſheweth how that in ſo doing, and by ſuch Suing for a <hi>Toleration</hi> here, yee ſtand not to your own principles, but change them with the <hi>Climate;</hi> whereof I ſay, what a very grave <hi>Preſident</hi> of the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> ſaid to the Ieſuits, upon the like caſe: The Lord keepe me from men that have one faith on the one, and another on the other ſide of the <hi>Alpes:</hi> So I to you, God keepe me from Men, who maintaine ſome Principles in <hi>America,</hi> or <hi>New England,</hi> and the contrary in <hi>Europe</hi> or in <hi>Old England.</hi> I pray you, holy Fathers, drinke together and agree, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ye come to put us here in combuſtion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M. S.</hi> Is the man ſo full of the ſpirit of Reprehenſion, againſt ſuch practiſes? and yet ſo full of the ſpirit of imitation? <hi>i. e.</hi> If <hi>A. S.</hi> reprove ſuch practiſes; he ſhould not imitate them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> I have anſwered, 1. That my Argument proves not, what I ſhould do; but what yee ſhould not do: It is <hi>Argumentum ad hominem:</hi> 2. I Anſwer again, that we perſecute not <hi>Independents,</hi> as you ſay; but hinder them, to ſow their Tares; They have never been, nor are they, nor are they ever like to be perſecuted by the <hi>Parliament,</hi> as I hope: I hope the <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents</hi> will have more Conſcience, then to give juſt occaſion unto the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> to puniſh them; but if they continue in their pertinacy and the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> refuſe then to grant them a <hi>Toleration,</hi> it will no more be a Perſecution, then it would be, to hinder men to blaſpheme Gods Name. 3. I cannot imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate them, for I have no power or authority, as thoſe, whoſe practiſes I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute; Onely I pleade for the Truth, and ſhew what ſhould be done. 4. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit I had authority amongſt the Dependents, as they have amongſt thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>Independent</hi> Creatures; yet could I not imitate them, in refuſing of a <hi>toleration;</hi> for the caſe would not be the ſame, or alike. 5. And I grant you, that if the Cauſe ye maintain, were as juſt, as it is unjuſt, thoſe of <hi>New England</hi> ſhould do well to refuſe us a <hi>Toleration.</hi> 6. And yet could they not ſo juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refuſe us our demand, as we refuſe you yours; for the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> who
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:124638:88"/>were Suitors for a <hi>Toleration</hi> in <hi>New England,</hi> were onely Suitors for <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians,</hi> and thoſe very few in number; whereas <hi>M. S.</hi> and his Collegues plead for a <hi>Toleration</hi> of all ſorts of <hi>Independents,</hi> yea of all the Sects of the World, for any thing we know.</p>
               <p>In the ſame Sect <hi>p.</hi> 103. He condemneth ſuch practiſes in his <hi>Brethren</hi> of <hi>New England,</hi> in ſaying, that in ſuch proceedings, they <hi>juſtified not themſelves in the ſight of God,</hi> viz. <hi>juſtitia cauſae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. Neither doth either God, or our Conſcience judge us in ſuch proceedings. i. e. Condemne us, for we judge according to Gods Word, that divers Sects, which yee would have <hi>Tolerated,</hi> are not to be <hi>Tolerated,</hi> but that they are all to be <hi>ſuppreſſed.</hi> 8. Whereas he ſayeth, that I am more of the Opinion of the <hi>Independents</hi> of <hi>New England,</hi> then the <hi>Apologiſts,</hi> I am glad, that he is aſhamed of his Fathers.</p>
               <p>And I agree with them in this, that <hi>Hereticks, Schiſmaticks,</hi> and <hi>Idolaters,</hi> are not to be <hi>Tolerated</hi> by the <hi>Church</hi> of God, which the <hi>Independents</hi> of <hi>Old England</hi> deny moſt boldly.</p>
               <p>What yee ſay of the <hi>Independent Apologiſts,</hi> that <hi>they profeſſe not perſecution meerly for little differences in point of Diſcipline;</hi> I Anſwer, 1. They do well to profeſſe it, ſince their power, as yet, is very ſmall; But what they may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, if they can get any power into their hands, we know not. 2. Onely we ſay, that the <hi>American Independents,</hi> who are <hi>Ejuſdem ſpeciei</hi> with you, ſo ſoon as ever they had authority, did other wayes, then yee ſay the <hi>Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geticall Independents</hi> do profeſſe without authority. 3. And it may be, that they being Miniſters, will profeſſe it; but will you aſſure us, that your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrats, who are <hi>Independents,</hi> ſhall profeſſe the ſame?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M. S.</hi> Addeth, if they did ſo for want of light, muſt this be a band of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience upon them to <hi>bow down their backs,</hi> and to ſuffer <hi>Presbyterian</hi> great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to <hi>go over them, as ſtones in the ſtreet?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> In a word, this is to deny the conſequence of my Major, which I have confirmed. But I Anſwer, 1. The Queſtion is not of <hi>Presbyterians;</hi> neither did I ſpeake of them in my Argument. 2. The <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> yea their Nationall <hi>Churches</hi> inflict none, but ſpirituall puniſhments, which every <hi>Congregationall Independent Church,</hi> compounded, peradventure of ſeven, or eight, idle Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes onely arrogate unto themſelves. 3. What you ſay of the want of <hi>Light</hi> in the <hi>Independents</hi> of <hi>New England,</hi> it is ridiculous; for they ſay, that they have more <hi>Light,</hi> then all the <hi>Quinqu' Eccleſian</hi> Miniſters, and will hold you, as blind, as yee hold them: No wonder, that ſo <hi>Independent Lights</hi> be ſo contradictory one to another. 4. I wonder how yee can call that rather a <hi>Presbyterian greatneſſe,</hi> wherein the Spirit of Prophets ſubmit unto Prophets, and the leſſe unto the greater <hi>Light,</hi> then that, wherein ſix, or ſeven, ſilly Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, and a little <hi>Independent</hi> Miniſter, be they never ſo erronious in their Opinions, and execrable in their lives, will not ſubmit unto the whole Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian World.</p>

                  <hi>M. S.</hi> Again, he ſayes <hi>p.</hi> 104. that out of feare they are Suitors for a <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration,</hi> if they do not beſtir themſelves by ſome means or other to prevent it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.

That the <hi>Independent</hi> party did offer to entertain 4000. men in theſe Wars, provided they might have had liberty to have made choyſe of their Commanders.</p>
               <p>What he ſayes in the reſt of this § in his 4. Anſwer, is but a tale, and is ſundry times anſwered.</p>
               <p>As for that he ſayes in the next § of my feare, it is a juſt feare, grounded upon experience.</p>
               <p>But <hi>M. S.</hi> Replyeth, 1. That ſome <hi>Independents</hi> hold, that all Sects and Opinions are to be <hi>Tolerated,</hi> as <hi>A. S.</hi> relateth. <hi>Ergo,</hi> In that caſe, his Sect may be ſecured alſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> I Anſwer to the Antecedent; And that We feare alſo, viz. That ye would <hi>Tolerate</hi> all Sects, which we will not <hi>Tolerate.</hi> 2. VVe cannot be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure among all Sects; for there be ſome that will not <hi>Tolerate</hi> us. 3.

I ſaid onely, that there be ſome of you, who would <hi>Tolerate</hi> all Sects, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure are the far leſſer part, and ſhould not prevaile in their Voices. 5. And we know not upon what tearmes they would <hi>tolerate</hi> us, if they were the ſtrongeſt. 6.

               <p>And what I ſaid of your Piety, it can ſerve you little. 1. For I ſpake but of a few of you, viz. of the 5. <hi>Apologiſts.</hi> 2. Becauſe, it was but a judgement of Charity, wherein I may be deceived, yea wherein I have been deceived. 3. Good men ſometimes may, for want of <hi>light,</hi> be <hi>dogged enough</hi> (to uſe your own tearmes) as ye grant your ſelfe of your <hi>New England Independents.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Unto his 3. Reply, That a poore <hi>Toleration</hi> is far from <hi>Superiority;</hi> it is true: But from a <hi>Toleration,</hi> it is to be feared, ye goe further: And if ye
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:124638:89"/>can get the Civill Magiſtrate drawn into your Faction, as in <hi>New-England,</hi> ye may be as <hi>dogged</hi> in a ſhort time, as they are.</p>
               <p>To the 4. Reply, That he thinketh not that I know any ſuch Iſland; It is a wonder that he knoweth it not, as well as I: but it is little to purpoſe; No more is his Anſwer, for it is but a curriſh jeere, and toucheth not the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at all. He puts in 5. a Jeere for a Reaſon; God have mercy on the ſilly Argumenter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> My 17. Argument was, That the Scripture forbiddeth all Toleration of Sects, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.20. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. &amp; 3.3. &amp; 11.16, 18, 19, 20. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.25. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M. S.</hi> his 1. Anſwer; <hi>The Scripture doth not forbid all, nor any ſuch Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the Apologiſts deſire;</hi> And remitteth us to his Anſwer unto my 15. Reaſon: And I remit the Reader to my Reply.</p>
               <p>To the Text of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> 2.20. he ſaith, That by the Toleration of Jezabel, <hi>is not meant <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Civill or State-toleration, but an Eccleſiaſtique or Church toleration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> Howbeit formally there only be meant an <hi>Eccleſiaſtique Toleration;</hi> yet by Conſequence it reaches to a <hi>State Toleration.</hi> 1. For whatſoever the Eccleſiaſticall Senate or Presbytery is bound not to <hi>tolerate,</hi> but muſt ſuppreſſe in the Church; that the Civill Magiſtrate or Senate is bound not to <hi>tolerate,</hi> but muſt ſuppreſſe in the State, ſince he is a Nurſe of the Church, and a Keeper of the two Tables. 2. And ſo did the Judges and the Kings of Gods people. 3. And ſo doe the Chriſtian Independent Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates in <hi>New-England.</hi> 4. Neither is the Chriſtian Magiſtrate leſſe bound to put it out of the State, then the Presbytery to put it out of the Church. 5. And I would willingly know of the five Apologiſts their judgement upon this Point: neither beleeve I, that they dare ſay, or at leaſt doe beleeve, that he is not bound to ſuppreſſe all ſort of Sects, that creep in into the Church, when the whole Kingdome profeſſeth the true Religion and Diſcipline. 6 However <hi>M. S.</hi> ſay, that they deſire only a <hi>toleration</hi> for themſelves and their <hi>Churches</hi> in the State, yet he pleadeth for a <hi>toleration</hi> for all Schiſmaticks, Hereticks, and Idolaters, that may ſpring up, either in their own, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Church. 7. Neither can the Civill Magiſtrate, if he follow Gods Word, grant a Toleration without the conſent of the Church, if he judge it is not corrupted. 8. And a Magiſtrate ſhould be worſe then mad, that ſhould permit a Sect to come into the Kingdome, to preach down the Goſpel, which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth. 9. Neither can he be Orthodox, and <hi>tolerate</hi> a new Sect, unleſſe he tolerate us to believe, that he is either corrupted by monies, or ſome other way, ſo to doe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M.S.</hi> his 2. Anſwer (<hi>p.</hi> 105.) is, That ſince only the Church of <hi>Thyatira</hi> is here charged with this Toleration, evident it is, that the power of redreſſing emerging enormities in a Church in every kind, is committed by Chriſt to
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:124638:89"/>every particular Church reſpectively within it ſelfe; and ſo that they muſt be cut off only by the particular Church, which is troubled by them, if there be no remedy otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.S.</hi> 1. At leaſt then, thus much I gaine by this Argument, as you confeſſe; That a particular Church muſt cut off ſuch as trouble her, and conſequently is bound not to <hi>tolerate</hi> them. 2. For the ſame reaſon, other Churches muſt not <hi>tolerate</hi> them, ſince they are all ſiſter-Churches; <hi>Ergo,</hi> no Church muſt tolerate them; <hi>Ergo,</hi> no member of the Church muſt <hi>tolerate</hi> them; If no member, <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Civill Magiſtrate in quality of a member of the Church, muſt not tolerate them, or he muſt tolerate them againſt his Conſcience: And what he cannot <hi>tolerate</hi> in the Church, as a member of the Chriſtian Church, that can he not <hi>tolerate</hi> in quality of a Chriſtian Magiſtrate in a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian State, if he can hinder it: And if he hath power to puniſh ſuch as trouble one particular Church, how much more hath he power to puniſh ſuch, as trouble all the Churches in the Kingdome, as Schiſmaticks, and Hereticks? The Civill Magiſtrate then by conſequence may cut them off from the State. As for that Queſtion which <hi>M. S.</hi> moveth here about the Independent power of particular Congregations, it is not to the purpoſe; and we diſcuſſe it more at large in its own place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.S.</hi> There muſt be no ſuch ſpeeches among us, as <hi>I am of Paul, I of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollos, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M.S.</hi> We joyn heart and hand with you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> And I with you; ſo they muſt not be <hi>tolerated,</hi> when they can be hindred.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M. S.</hi> addeth here a <hi>But:</hi> 1. Every man that ſaith, <hi>I am of Paul,</hi> or <hi>I am of Apollos,</hi> is not to be taught to ſpeak better by fining, impriſoning, un-Churching, or the like; but by ſoundneſſe of Conviction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> I anſwer, as I have ſundry times done: Sinners, according to the Doctrine of our Churches are, 1. To be heard; 2. To be ſufficiently convicted; 3. After ſufficient conviction, if they be pertinacious, to be puniſhed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignely by Eccleſiaſticall Cenſures, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuſpenſion from the Lords Table, or Excommunication: And afterward the Civill Magiſtrate is to doe his duty, as a Nurſe of the Church, in compelling them by the Civill power, to obey the Church: But in both theſe puniſhments, <hi>viz.</hi> Spirituall and Temporall, it is not for the Sinner to judge whether or no he be ſufficiently convicted, ſince he being a Party, cannot be Iudge in his own cauſe; but it is the part of the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall Senate to judge, whether he be ſufficiently convicted <hi>in foro Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtico;</hi> and of the Civill Magiſtrate to judge, whether he be ſufficiently convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted <hi>in foro Civili,</hi> in that, whereof he is to judge.</p>
               <p>To your 2. Anſwer; I reply, That by <hi>Browniſts, Independents, Anabaptiſts,</hi> &amp;c. I meane not the names, but the things ſignified by ſuch names.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.S. Neither hath the Church of Goda cuſtome to be contentious,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.16.
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:124638:90"/>This I brought to prove, that Schiſmes are not to be <hi>tolerated;</hi> for they breed Contentions in <hi>Churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M.S.</hi> 3. But he doth not ſay, that theſe <hi>Churches of God</hi> had any cuſtome to erect a <hi>Presbyterian throne,</hi> or a <hi>combined Elderſhip</hi> amongſt them, to keep them from Contentions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> I anſwer you M. S. that I muſt endure your impertinencie; 1. For if you had frequented our <hi>Presbyteries,</hi> you ſhould have ſeen, that they have no Throne. 2. You might have ſeen, that by this Argument I intended not to prove a <hi>combined Presbytery,</hi> as you call it; but the <hi>intolerableneſſe</hi> of a <hi>toleration</hi> of <hi>Sects.</hi> I prove ſufficiently elſewhere, what you can deſire about the <hi>ſubordination</hi> of <hi>Eccleſiaſticall Judicatories.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> Neither permitteth the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> Schiſmes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M. S.</hi> ſaith, that he hath already anſwered this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> ſaith, that he hath replied to <hi>M. S.</hi> his Anſwer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.S.</hi> We muſt not quit our mutuall meetings, as others doe, and as muſt be done in a publike Toleration, (<hi>Heb.</hi> 10.25.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M. S.</hi> We underſtand not your words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> But they are the Apoſtles words. 2. And my Argument may eaſily be formed by any Logician, againſt <hi>Toleration;</hi> It will be thus:</p>
               <p>What maketh us to quit our mutuall meetings, as others doe, is not to be tolerated:</p>
               <p>But Schiſmes and Hereſies make us to quit our mutuall meetings: <hi>Ergo,</hi> They are not to be tolerated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M.S.</hi> We doe not know, what <hi>quitting of meetings</hi> there is like to be more under a <hi>publique Toleration,</hi> then is for the preſent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.S.</hi> So he ſeemeth to deny the Minor; but I prove it; for in <hi>tolerating</hi> of Schiſmes, we ſee, that men, being deceived by the Schiſmaticks, doe quit the meetings of the Church, to which before they were joyned: And we ſee, how the <hi>Independents</hi> frequent not willingly our Churches, and will not all joyne with us in our meetings at the Lords Table: Neither beleeve I, that any of the five Apologetick Miniſters have ever communicated in our Aſſemblies, ſince this Parliament.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> 18. Becauſe that <hi>M.S.</hi> chargeth my 18. Reaſon with Atheiſme, I will put it in forme:</p>
               <p>That which <hi>per ſe,</hi> giveth offence unto Papiſts, and others, or that expoſeth the Proteſtant Churches unto the calumnies of Papiſts, ſhould not be granted by us:</p>
               <p>But, the Toleration of many Sects doth ſo; <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is not to be granted.</p>
               <p>The Major is certaine; for it is <hi>ſcandalum datum,</hi> which all Divines doe condemne.</p>
               <p>The Minor, I prove it; for it giveth, and the Papiſts thereupon take too
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:124638:90"/>juſt a cauſe of Scandall or Offence; and indeed it cannot but be a juſt ſubject of Offence, by to open to be reproached with ſuch an innumerable number of Sects, to the renting of Chriſts Churches in peeces.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M. S.</hi> to this anſwereth not, but propoundeth ſome Queſtions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Will you, ſaith he, redeem your ſelf out of the hands of the Papiſts ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies by ſymbolizing with them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> I Anſwer, 1. That it is no ſymbolizing with Papiſts if we <hi>tolerate</hi> not <hi>Hereticks</hi> and <hi>Schiſmaticks;</hi> for you have already confeſſed, that in your <hi>particular Churches</hi> you <hi>tolerate</hi> them not; and yet you beleeve that your <hi>Churches</hi> ſymbolize no more with them then ours. 2. It is a ſtrange thing, if my Argument be <hi>Atheologicall,</hi> if it prove, that <hi>Atheiſts</hi> and ſuch as deny the <hi>Trinity,</hi> and the <hi>Incarnation</hi> of the Son of God, are not to be <hi>tolerated;</hi> If ſuch an Argument be <hi>Atheologicall</hi> in your judgement, I am aſſured that all <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues</hi> will conceive better of it, then of this your <hi>Theologicall Anſwer.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have I forgot my 11. Reaſon, for you ſymbolize with them in their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, and I in true <hi>Theologie,</hi> viz. in maintaining the Unity of the <hi>Church</hi> with Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> as you ſymbolize with <hi>Sectaries</hi> in maintaining the <hi>renting</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> by <hi>Schiſmes:</hi> If you had ſhewen any Contradiction in my words, I had either anſwered it, or, if I could not, I ſhould have rendered my ſelf to the truth: But <hi>M. S.</hi> will not prove it, but terrifies me, as a Child, with his great words; It ſeemeth, (ſaith he) <hi>Contradictions, Inconſiſtencyes, Impertinencyes, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n-intelligibilities, ſence, non-ſence, any thing, nothing, &amp;c. A. S.</hi> All this is no ſence, nothing, but words and wind of <hi>Goodwin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the <hi>19th.</hi> Reaſon, he remitteth us to the former Queſtion to ſeeke an Anſwer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> 20. If it (i. e. <hi>Toleration</hi>) be granted, it cannot, but be thought, that it hath been granted, or rather extorted by force of reaſon, and that all the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> were not able to anſwer our <hi>Brethren,</hi> whereas indeed their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions and Demands are againſt all Reaſon, as ſundry of themſelves could not deny, and had nothing to ſay, ſave onely that it was Gods Ordinance, which yet they could never ſhew out of Gods Word: On the contrary, if it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, it will help to confirme the <hi>Churches,</hi> and the people in the truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M. S.</hi> In ſubſtance, 1. denieth that a <hi>Toleration</hi> will ſeeme to be extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, if it be granted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> But if a thing ſo abſurd, and againſt all Piety be granted by ſo vener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able an <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> wherein things are carried by Reaſon, it cannot ſeeme but extorted by Reaſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M. S.</hi> ſaith, that I tell the <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> that howſoever their Conſciences might ſavour the <hi>Independents</hi> in point of <hi>Toleration,</hi> yet their credits and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations would ſuffer by it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> It is falſe; there is no ſuch expreſſion in my Booke, it is not my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, but <hi>M. S.</hi> his fiction and impoſture.</p>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:124638:91"/>
               <p>Neither ſhould the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> (in my poore Opinion) ſo eaſily ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be intreated for ill; neither is there any mercy in <hi>tolerating</hi> and not ſuppreſſing of <hi>Schiſmes</hi> and <hi>Hereſies,</hi> as <hi>M. S.</hi> beleeveth.</p>
               <p>M. S. denieth, that their Opinion and Demand is againſt all Reaſon, but I have ſundry times proved it, viz. Becauſe, by ſuch a <hi>Toleration</hi> of <hi>Independen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> all ſorts of <hi>Hereſies</hi> will creepe into the <hi>Church;</hi> and it is moſt abſurd, that there ſhould be no <hi>Eccleſiaſticall</hi> power to repreſſe the <hi>Hereſies</hi> and abominable ſins of ſeven or eight wicked Fellowes, whereof a particular <hi>Independent Church</hi> may be compoed, in caſe they fall into <hi>Hereſie,</hi> or ſuch abominable ſins.</p>
               <p>Whereas M. S. ſaies, that it is not like, that ſo very learned men, &amp;c. ſuch as are the 5. <hi>Apologiſts,</hi> ſhould riſe up to defend an opinion ſo contrary to all reaſon.</p>
               <p>A. S. It is more like that learned men of great abilities ſhould do ſo, then ignorants that have not the abilities. The Devill is learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eder, then they all, and yet ſuſteineth as abſurd Opinions: Divine <hi>Plato</hi> as learned, as they, defended the Community of Wives, of Children, and Goods: <hi>Zeno</hi> did maintaine, that there was no moving at all: So did ſundry great Philoſophers maintaine great Errors; and great Divines, as <hi>Origine,</hi> and ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry of the Fathers ſtrangely miſtooke ſundry things. If-they be ſo Learned, I may ſay of them, what an other ſaid of a very Learned man, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi bene, nemo, meliùs, ubi malè, nemo pejùs,</hi> where they do well, no men do better; where they do ill, no man doeth worſe: For, <hi>Optima, cum degenerant, fiunt peſſima,</hi> as the Philoſophers tell us. If formerly I gave them ſo great praiſes, it was out of Charity, which they ſhould not take in <hi>rigore juſtitiae:</hi> And I muſt tell you, that I have been grievouſly cenſured for that my Charitable judgement, and that by very learned and godly Divines, both here by word of mouth, and by ſome others abroad by Letters, which I could eaſily ſhew, if occaſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. What if my Charity gave them as great praiſes as they were capable of? However it be, great men may have great Errours; what if there be a great Pride with great Learning, ſince it is moſt certain that <hi>Scientia inflat?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither, for all their Plea for the power of godlineſſe amongſt them above all the World, and that they do what <hi>Fleſh and Bloud can do in any juncture of time to come,</hi> muſt they pleade, that they are without ſin.</p>
               <p>I thought not, that ſuch praiſes would ſo have puffed them up, as to have made them thus bragging in their Writings; For if they anſwer not my commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of them, they affront me; and then I ſhall pray them not to be proud of my praiſes, but to merit them: And I ſhall intreat others to pardon my mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken Charity; Bring not my Charity by any meanes for an Argument againſt me: Beleeve, I pray you, that praiſes ſignifie rather the vertue, that ſhould be, and that we expect of men, then that, that evermore is.</p>
               <p>If you, and they, will not be ſuch, as I take you to be, you muſt give me leave to take you for ſuch, as ye are.</p>
               <p>As for the Protoſtants in <hi>France,</hi> their example of Suing for a <hi>toleration</hi>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:124638:91"/>of their <hi>Religion,</hi> ſerves you nothing; 1. For they have obtained it, as I told you, by the ſword, in fighting for their <hi>Proteſtant Prince,</hi> againſt Papiſts; 2. And their <hi>Diſcipline</hi> opens not a gate to all <hi>Hereſies</hi> and <hi>Licenciouſneſſe,</hi> as yours. 3. And if they had had no greater difference with the Papiſts, then the Independents ſay they have with us, they had never been ſo mad as to have either fought, or ſued ſo long for it. 4. They were compelled to Idolatry, and to be Actors in the damnation of their own ſouls, againſt the light of their Conſciences; but ye can ſay no ſuch thing for your ſelves; neither is it more reaſon, that ſuch Proteſtants, as ye are, ſhould be rather <hi>tolerated</hi> by Proteſtants; for <hi>your Diſcipline,</hi> as I have ſundry times ſaid, openeth a door to all Hereſies and Corruptions, that Satan can invent; it is worſe by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence a hundred times, then either Popery or Arminianiſm are formally.</p>
               <p>As for your eminent deſerts and merits, 1. I know them not. 2. As ſome Independents may merit, and deſerve well of the State; ſo may others deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit as much. 3. But no man can merit a licentiouſneſſe to be wicked, and to bring a miſchief upon the State and Church both, ſuch as a Toleration of all Sects and Hereſies would bring: If you cannot ſubmit unto a common Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church, as others, and live <hi>more humano,</hi> it is againſt all reaſon, that ye ſhould be <hi>tolerated;</hi> neither muſt Religion be framed according to your Accommodation, as you pretend, but your Accommodation rather ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Religion. To your Demand about thoſe that are of my Iudgement; they needed not to be ſuiters for a Toleration; for the Diſcipline, that they ſuffered for, was already eſtabliſhed by Law; As for the reſt of this Section, it containeth onely his proud Iudgement of my Reaſons, and ſome fooleries, which I hold it not worth the while, to take notice of.</p>
               <p>To your <hi>ſecondly,</hi> I anſwer, that thoſe, of whom I ſay, that ſundry of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves could not deny it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are not the five Apologiſts, but others Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Miniſters, and ſome of the ableſt among them, whom I did entertain upon that diſcourſe: And <hi>M.

               <p n="3">3. <hi>M. S.</hi> ſaith, that they have ſhewn it from Gods Word; but God and men (it ſeems) are not yet agreed to have it ſo generally ſeen, as is to be deſired.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> Neither is it ſhewn, neither can it appear, <hi>Nam non entis nulla ſunt accidentia,</hi> things that are not, have no Accidents, neither can they be ſeen; And what men can agree unto, I know not; for ſome times they dream, that they ſee things, that are not: But ſure I am, that God will never agree, that it be according to his Word. And what you ſay of your hope, all the Kings of the World cannot hinder you to hope; for no man is without all hope, but
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:124638:92"/>the damned ſouls in Hell: Onely this I ſay, That of your hope, you may ſay, <hi>O ſpes inanes.</hi>

Toleration,</hi> but overthrow all ſort of <hi>Eccleſiaſticall Government;</hi> for a man being cenſured in one Church, may fly to an other; and being again ſuſpended in that other, fly from thence to another; and ſo ſcorn all the Churches of God, and their Cenſures; and ſo this Order, by neceſſary conſequence, will breed all ſort of diſorder.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M. S.</hi> Anſwereth, 1. That he joyeth, that I Propheſie, that the <hi>Independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Government</hi> will overthrow all other <hi>Government,</hi> and addeth, <hi>Faxit Deus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> 1. My words contain no propheſie, but a conſequence. 2. I ſaid not, that the <hi>Independent Government,</hi> which is no <hi>Government,</hi> but <hi>aequivocè,</hi> as <hi>canis coeleſtis</hi> is <hi>canis;</hi> but that the <hi>toleration</hi> of <hi>Independent Government</hi> would overthrow all Government. 3. In the 2. §. of that Page 110. he acknowledgeth his miſtake, becauſe of my following words: And ſo this Order by neceſſary Conſequence will breed all ſort of diſorder.</p>
               <p>To this <hi>M.S.</hi> anſwereth, 1. That it will not breed the diſorder of oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Conſciencious men, for Conſcience ſake.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> 1. <hi>All ſort of diſorder</hi> muſt not be taken <hi>pro ſingulis generum, ſed pro generibus ſingulorum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Syncategorema, all,</hi> there ſignifies onely a great number of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders.</p>
               <p n="3">3. No more doth the Presbyterian Order oppreſſe Conſciencious men, or do any thing, that you tell there.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Howbeit it breed not thoſe diſorders, which you mention there, yet it breedeth ſundry other diſorders, which we have already demonſtrated.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It oppreſſeth Conſciencious men, 1. In hindering them to get their Conſciences fully ſatisfied in a higher Indicatory. 2.

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:124638:92"/>them to be gone from their Congregation, and ſo undo them, 3. In making them to attend, peradventure a yeer, or two, before they will meet with other Churches, to have their unjuſt Iudgement judged and reverſed; of which practiſes, ſee ſundry very ſtrange Stories in Maſter <hi>Edwards</hi> Book, who knoweth them <hi>intus &amp; in cute;</hi> which one of their Sect, writing in their favour not many dayes ago, doth ingenuouſly confeſſe, <hi>They make not</hi> (indeed) <hi>men to walk ſundry miles, for what they might have at home;</hi> but they ſundry times oppreſſe them at home, and undo them, for what they might have gotten within a few miles, for the hundred part of the loſſe that they ſuffered at home; whereof ſee Maſter <hi>Edwards</hi> his <hi>Antapologia.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. <hi>M. S.</hi> denieth, that they may run from Church to Church: But I prove it, for if other Churches be Independent of all <hi>Authoritative Power,</hi> they may admit them; and howbeit, they could not run from Church to Church, yet could they ſet up a Church themſelves, compounded of ſeven or eight debauched Fellows like unto themſelves, as they do here in <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M. S.</hi> ſcorneth to anſwer the reſt of my Reaſons, amounting to the number of ſeven, under pretext, that I ſay, that I omitted them; but however I omit them, the judicious Reader will do well to take notice of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M. S.</hi> in all this Chapter bringeth but one onely Text of Scripture for his Opinion, and that not by way of Argument, but of Anſwer to one of my Arguments; but in the beginning of it, he hath ſome ten frivolous Arguments grounded on the corrupt Reaſon of his own brains, which I will here ſet down in order, and anſwer them; hoping through Gods Mercy, that the very weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Independents Reaſons, (howbeit we brought no Reaſons at all againſt them) would evidently ſhew, how ſleight their Opinions, and how fond their conceits are.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M. S.</hi> Suppoſe the Opinion, maintained in the latter part of the ſecond Chapter, were waved, and ſuch a <hi>Coercive Power,</hi> in matters of Religion, as <hi>A. S.</hi> contends for, allowed in the Magiſtrates hand; yet, that any man ſhould plead for the drawing of his ſword againſt thoſe men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And a little after, that any (I ſay) on this ſide of <hi>malignancy,</hi> ſhould conſult the ſorrow, trouble, diſgrace, ſuppreſſion, ruine of men ſo holy, ſo harmleſſe, of ſuch eminent deſert in the Cauſe of Religion, State, Kingdom, me thinks ſhould exceed the line of Humanity, and be thought ſome Inſpiration or Suggeſtion from the great Enemy of mankinde.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> 1. This Diſcourſe ſeemeth to imply two Arguments.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Men very holy, very harmleſſe, of very eminent deſerts in the Cauſe of Religion, State, Kingdom, ſhould not receive ſorrow, trouble, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, ſuppreſſion, or ruine.</p>
               <p>But we the Independents are ſuch. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M. S.</hi> his ſecond Argument, They who plead for the drawing of the ſword,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:124638:93"/>conſult ſorrow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> againſt ſo holy men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have ſome Inſpiration from the Devill, or great Enemy of mankinde.</p>
               <p>But <hi>A. S.</hi> pleads for the drawing of the ſword, <hi>&amp;c. Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the firſt Argument I anſwer: 1. In generall, That I am ſorry, that this <hi>M. S.</hi> will hazard the Independents honour in ſo weak an Argument; for if I deny the Minor, they will preſently cry out, that I offend their pretended <hi>Power of Piety, their harmleſſeneſſe,</hi> &amp;c. And therefore, not to offend them, I will not ſay, that they are not ſuch: Onely I ſay, that whoſoever pleads for a <hi>Toleration</hi> of all damnable and moſt deteſtable Hereticks, (ſuch as deny the Trinity, the Incarnation of the Son of God, his Mediatorſhip, who call him a Knave, and an Impoſtor, who died for us all) as this <hi>M. S.</hi> doth here in his Book, can neither be <hi>holy</hi> nor <hi>harmleſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. I deny the Major, if it be taken abſolutely, without any diſtinction; for if <hi>the Righteous turn from his righteouſneſſe, and do the thing that is wicked, he ſhall die therein, Ezek.</hi> 33.28. So they are not to ſuffer for their harmleſſeneſſe, and eminent gifts, but for ſomething worſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I muſt ſay, That the Minor ſmelleth ſomewhat the Phariſee, who ſeemed juſt in his own eyes: And to ſay nothing elſe, we can produce you a great number of Independents, and Independent Miniſters no better, then other mortall men.</p>
               <p>To the ſecond Argument, I anſwer to the Major. 1. <hi>They have ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration,</hi> &amp;c. if they <hi>conſult ſorrow</hi> againſt them for their <hi>holineſſe,</hi> it is true: But the Minor is falſe; for I never pleaded any ſorrow againſt them, for their <hi>holineſſe;</hi> neither am I minded to plead any <hi>ſorrow,</hi> or the drawing of the ſword againſt them; but onely againſt ſuch who are turbulent, and trouble the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State;</hi> who <hi>erect Churches in deſpite of the Parliament,</hi> or overthrow <hi>the Kings, the Parliaments, and all Civill Magiſtrates Authority,</hi> about the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will not anſwer unto this Independents Injuries, when he calleth all thoſe, <hi>Malignants,</hi> who plead for the Civill Magiſtrates Power, as I do, and <hi>men inſpired</hi> by the <hi>Devill.</hi> Onely this I ſay, That if ſuch men who curb ſo the Kings, the Parliaments, and all Civill Magiſtrates Authority, in ſuch a manner, ſhould be protected and maintained by them, as they pretend they ſhould be, and vaunt they will be, (which yet I hope ſhall never be) that <hi>turdus ſibi malum cacat,</hi> and that they are worthy to drink ſuch, as they brew.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M. S.</hi> The Independents have ſuch a conſiderable ſtrength, if not of evidence, yet of reaſon for what they practiſe and profeſſe: <hi>A. S. Ergo,</hi> I know not what. I think he would infer, they ſhould not ſuffer ſorrow, but be <hi>tolerated.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> 1. I know not what <hi>M. S.</hi> meaneth by his <hi>ſtrength</hi> here, for he ſeemeth to ſay, That it is <hi>ſtrength</hi> of <hi>reaſon,</hi> and then we deny the Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent;
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:124638:93"/>for if they had any, they ſhould do well to ſhew it, and not to vaunt of it. 2. He is not confident to call it evident: <hi>Ergo,</hi> It is inevident and obſcure: <hi>Ergo,</hi> It is uncertain, if theſe <hi>reaſons</hi> or <hi>ſtrength</hi> be taken from <hi>Nature;</hi> for in <hi>Nature,</hi> all <hi>Reaſons</hi> that are inevident are uncertain; if he meaneth <hi>Reaſons</hi> taken from <hi>divine Authority,</hi> then he needed not to doubt, in ſaying, if <hi>not in evidence;</hi> for all Arguments, taken from <hi>divine Authority,</hi> are inevident: And the meaneſt Logicians know, that <hi>Argumentum ab Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritate ductum, eſt inevidens &amp; inartificiale:</hi> And Faith, which is evermore inevident, is ſuch, becauſe that it is grounded upon Authority, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M. S.</hi> 2. They, <hi>i. e.</hi> Independents have a like, if not a more conſiderable ſtrength againſt that way of Government, which they cannot ſubmit unto. <hi>A. S. Ergo,</hi> What followeth? They muſt be <hi>tolerated?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> 1. Is this to argue, to aſſume the Antecedent in both theſe Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſo peremptoriouſly without any proof? Truely a Midwife might have argued every jot as well: I deny it; and let the Reader judge of both our Reaſons.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I deny the Conſequence; for howbeit they had as conſiderable a ſtrength of Reaſons, as the other way; yet ſhould not their way be admitted; for if the other be already approved by Authority, and the Independent way not yet admitted, the old way, which is as probable as theirs, is not to be put away for yours; For all Changes in Church, and State, are very dangerous, unleſſe ſome urgent neceſſity preſſe it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And there is ſomething in their way, which may eaſily overthrow all States and Churches, wherein it may be admitted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M. S.</hi> 3. They are by their fierceſt Adverſaries, and Oppoſites themſelves, acknowledged ten times over for very <hi>pious, godly,</hi> and <hi>learned men. Ergo,</hi> They muſt be <hi>tolerated.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> Theſe men are almoſt mad, in <hi>praiſing,</hi> and in <hi>hearing</hi> of others <hi>praiſe</hi> their <hi>Piety, Godlineſſe,</hi> and <hi>Learning,</hi> as if this were the <hi>finis ultimus</hi> of this Sect: Neither ever heard I of any Sect ſo fooliſh, as this, that is ever more trumpeting abroad its own praiſes. <hi>We</hi> are <hi>holy; we</hi> are <hi>pious; we</hi> have the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>piety:</hi> And <hi>all</hi> the <hi>World acknowledges us for holy men;</hi> And there is <hi>none,</hi> that have the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>piety,</hi> or like to have <hi>it in any juncture</hi> of time to come, as <hi>we have it.</hi> Theſe ſeem rather the Expreſſions of ſome diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered brain, or at leaſt of a man very vain, then of any wiſe or godly Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian: Wherefore, inſtead of ſparing of you, and concealing ſome of theſe weakneſſes of yours, which I thought to have paſſed over in ſilence; ſince I am put to it, hear what I ſay to the Argument.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. I deny then the Conſequence; for howbeit ſome acknowledge you for ſuch, yet they are but very few, who acknowledge you ſuch; 2. And yet it is but <hi>Toſtimonium humanum,</hi> which is onely a <hi>Topick,</hi> or <hi>probable,</hi> and no <hi>certain</hi> or <hi>neceſſary</hi> Argument. 3. It is but the Teſtimony of one man, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <pb n="176" facs="tcp:124638:94"/>of <hi>A. S.</hi> whereof (for any thing I know) ye make little eſteem. 4. I deny, That if <hi>A. S.</hi> commend you for ſome good. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Ye ſhould be <hi>tolerated</hi> in your fooliſh, and pernicious practiſes, which cannot, but in all morall proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, overthrow the State, and the Church of God: There muſt onely be one Government admitted in the Church, what ever it be, whether yours, ours, or any other, and that for fear of Diviſions.</item>
                  <item>2. As for the Antecedent, indeed it was my judgement of <hi>Charity,</hi> which <hi>ſuffereth long, and is kinde; envieth not; vaunteth not it ſelf,</hi> as ye do, <hi>is not puffed up,</hi> as ye are; that <hi>is not eaſily provoked, thinketh not evil; beareth all things, beleeveth all things; hopeth all things; endureth all things,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.4, 5, 7. But ſince that time having read <hi>M. S.</hi> his Book (licenced, doubtleſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by ſome Independent, or ſome other diſguiſed perſon) ſo ſtuffed with theſe his impious Maximes againſt the Church, the State, and all Piety, and with mine own ears, heard ſome very dangerous Expreſſions of the Sectaries, who paſſe under the name of Independents, I have at leaſt changed much, or ſuſpended my former judgement of them; <hi>For Charity rejoyteth not in Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but rejoyceth in the Truth.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>I will not ſpeak ill of your <hi>perſons;</hi> but if Maſter <hi>Edwards</hi> have ſuch things under the Independents hands, as his Book mentions, as in <hi>Charity</hi> I am bound to beleeve he hath, I am bound to think otherwayes, then I have done, of your Opinions. And howbeit, I had never heard, or read any ſuch things of the Independents; yet it is too much for you (Sir) ſo proudly to inſult up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a bare judgement of <hi>Charity;</hi> Know you not, that <hi>praiſes</hi> and great <hi>commendations</hi> of <hi>vertues,</hi> are rather to ſhew what men ſhould be, then alwayes what they are. <hi>Wiſe</hi> and <hi>godly men</hi> reſt not ſo much upon other mens Teſtimonies, as upon that of a good Conſcience.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M. S.</hi> 4. Argument: <hi>Independents</hi> have been (at leaſt the generality of them) and ſo continue, <hi>men</hi> of the <hi>moſt affectionate,</hi> and with all the moſt effectuall <hi>activity</hi> and <hi>forwardneſſe,</hi> to <hi>promote</hi> the great <hi>cauſe of Religion, Parliament,</hi> and <hi>Kingdom. Ergo,</hi> Without all doubt they muſt be <hi>tolerated.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> 1. It is a wonder, how this man is not aſhamed, bringing ſo little reaſon for his Concluſion, ſo to vaunt. 2. This Antecedent is odious, containing nothing elſe, but a proud and impertinent compariſon. I ſhould be ſorry to go on upon this fooliſh way with him: God knoweth, who have moſt advanced the buſineſſe, or retarded it: Truely, it is the common ſpeech of wiſe men, that none but the <hi>Independent Faction retards Buſineſſes</hi> in the <hi>Aſſembly.</hi> 3. If the way to promote the <hi>buſineſſe,</hi> be to plead for <hi>impunity,</hi> in favour of Gods Enemies, of all Heretiques and Schiſmatiques, this <hi>M. S.</hi> indeed then promoteth it, as much as any man. 4. As for the <hi>activity</hi> of your <hi>Faction,</hi> ye are all but too active in thoſe things, wherein your pains were a great deal better ſpared.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M. S.</hi> his fifth Argument. <hi>Independents</hi> are as <hi>deep in,</hi> or (if you will) as
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:124638:94"/>
                  <hi>much out</hi> of their <hi>Eſtates</hi> rateably, for the <hi>ſupport of this Cauſe,</hi> as any other <hi>ſort</hi> of men whatſoever. <hi>Ergo,</hi> They muſt be <hi>tolerated</hi> in their <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>practiſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> 1. And yet will he continue, as the Phariſees did, to publiſh with ſound of Trumpet, the Works of <hi>Supererogation</hi> of the <hi>Independent Sect.</hi> 2. Yea, but what if many ſay, that many of them have bettered their Eſtates by this War? 3. I will not enter into conteſtation with this man, about mens <hi>disburſements</hi> in this <hi>Cauſe;</hi> for I never reckoned with them, what was in their purſes, or how much they are now out of purſe: But it ſeemeth, that <hi>M. S.</hi> hath calculated to a Farthing every mans Eſtate, and what he hath laid out in this War: If ſo, I pray you <hi>M. S.</hi> tell me, what Souldiers and Officers; whether of the <hi>Independents, Presbyterians,</hi> or others, have been beſt payed? 4. I deny the Conſequence; for they muſt not buy a <hi>toleration</hi> of their odde wayes and practiſes with Mony; for that were no better, then Simony; if they laid it out with aym at any ſuch thing, they are worthy to be deceived.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M. S.</hi> his ſixth Argument. They have many of them, ſuch as were meet for ſuch a Service, adventured their Perſons and Lives in the face of the rage and fury of the common Enemy, continuing ſtill in the ſame Ingagements. <hi>Ergo,</hi> They muſt be <hi>tolerated.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> 1. Will you never deſiſt from bragging of your Independent <hi>merits,</hi> and from making of theſe odious compariſons. 2. It is a ſtrange thing, that this <hi>M. S.</hi> who, as I hear, is but a Miniſter, having no other Calling, can judge ſo peremptoriouſly of all mens <hi>Eſtates, Piety,</hi> and <hi>Valour:</hi> Men, who knoweth him not, in reading of ſuch Stories, would think, that he had been evermore in the Field; and had ſeen a proof of every particular mans valour in all theſe Fights. 3. But did not many others, that were but merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, yea, eightpeny Souldiers, as much? 4. And yet will ye not infer, I trow, from thence, that they merit a <hi>toleration</hi> in their wicked wayes. 5. It is a poor advantage for you, to compare your ſelves with good men, in that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in many ill men, yea, wicked men may compare with you both, yea, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance go beyond you. 6. They have indeed done well; but it was for the maintenance of their Eſtates, for their Countrey, and for their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the <hi>French,</hi> yea, others alſo, and thoſe <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> came out of their Countrey, that had no Eſtates, or Liberties here to loſe; and yet did what they could for the Cauſe; and yet will not I compare them with any others, for fear leaſt I ſhould offend them both.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M. S.</hi> his ſeventh Argument. Some of them have expoſed themſelves to more danger, and harder terms from the Adverſe Party, then ordinary (in caſe they ſhould prevail) by a publike vindication of the Cauſe of the Parliament in Print, from the Scriptures, and that before any man of differing judgement from them in Church-Affairs, appeared in the Cauſe, upon ſuch
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:124638:95"/>terms. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Men ſo holy, ſo harmleſſe, of ſuch eminent deſert in the Cauſe of Religion, State, and Kingdom, ſhould be <hi>tolerated.</hi>

                  <hi>A. S.</hi> 1. But what a Braggadochio is this? Its pitty, but he had been a <hi>Spaniard;</hi> What is there in all theſe Arguments, but bragging, boaſting, vaunting, and proud, and odious compariſons? I will ſay nothing here of this Sect, yet muſt I ſay of this <hi>M. S.</hi> and the reſt of the Ring-leaders of it, That I have never read of any Divines ſo ſelf-conceited. 2. No man can ſay, that any of theſe Arguments have any other <hi>medium</hi> or <hi>ground,</hi> ſave <hi>pride,</hi> and <hi>ſelf-conceit:</hi> It is for ought, we know, or that appeareth in writing, the likeſt to <hi>Lucifers,</hi> that ever we ſaw. 3. If ſuch cracking merit any Anſwer at all, the Antecedent is notoriouſly falſe; for the <hi>Scots</hi> appeared before that any of your Independents ever ſhewed their Heads, yea, before that the Parliament was called here. Maſter <hi>Prynne</hi> alſo, who is no Independent, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared from the beginning, and yet continues a man in Learning, Piety, and Reading, as I beleeve, inferiour to none of you all; as appeareth by his writing againſt Arminians, Epiſcopacy, yea, and the Archb. of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> in the moſt dangerous times, having put him down by Scripture, and invincible Arguments grounded thereupon; and afterwards by his Law, ſo involved him in Premunires, that what ever Counſell he could take, he could never Extri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate himſelf. Neither did he, as your pretended Martyrs, when he was in priſon; he ſcorned to live upon other mens purſes, or to make himſelf rich by his Martyrdom, in taking, what ever good Chriſtians could offer them; he was chargeable to no man; and yet I am aſſured, as I am well informed, he might by his ſufferings have become rich: Neither ſay I this to flatter him, or to depreſſe you, (for I never frequented him much; neither, according to ordinary Providence, can I in time to come, have much to do with any of you) but to beat down that inſupportable and proud Argument of yours, grounded upon your <hi>merits</hi> of <hi>Supererogation.</hi> It would ſeem by your Diſcourſe, that neither Heaven, nor Earth, is ſufficient to recompence ſo deſerving men. 4. I deny the Conſequence; for your Sect is not to be <hi>tolerated</hi> for any ſervice you have done to the State, if it be not <hi>conform</hi> to <hi>Gods Word.</hi> 1. For Ile warrant you, if Jews could obtain ſuch a <hi>Toleration,</hi> as ye aym at, they would appear upon the ſame terms, as you do. 2. And the Popiſh Rebels of <hi>Ireland</hi> propound the ſame Argument to the Kings Majeſty, that ye propound here. 5. They deal a great deal fairer, who preſſe every man to keep his <hi>Covenant</hi> with God; in pulling down of <hi>Popery, Arminianiſm,</hi> all <hi>Sects</hi> and <hi>Hereſies,</hi> according to their ſolemn <hi>Oath,</hi> for a <hi>Toleration</hi> whereof you are here a ſuiter, againſt your <hi>Oath. Ergo,</hi> I will ſay nothing but this, That it is juſt with God, that he never <hi>tolerate</hi> them, who will <hi>tolerate</hi> ſo <hi>many Sects,</hi> to diſhonour him: As for my ſelf, if all the World ſhould ſubſcribe ſuch an <hi>Oath,</hi> I hope in <hi>Gods Mercy,</hi> I ſhould never be drawn to ſubſcribe it: 7. Neither think I, that any man can do it, without <hi>perjury,</hi> and manifeſt breach of that <hi>ſolemn Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi>
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:124638:95"/>already entred into. The Lord preſerve us from playing thus faſt, and looſe with <hi>Oaths.</hi> 8. If ſuch a <hi>Toleration</hi> of <hi>all Sects,</hi> which this man diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes ſo hard for, were granted, what could it be, but the utter diſhonour of this Parliament, the Church of God, and all the three Kingdoms? 9. Should not the Jeſuites have juſt ſubject to jeer at all the Books we have formerly writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten againſt their Equivocations, if we our ſelves ſhould ſo equivocate with the living God? 10. Should we not juſtifie the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> who have ſo calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niated, and cryed down the Parliament, for <hi>bringing in, and tolerating of ſo many Sects and Hereſies, Tub-Preaching? &amp;c.</hi> 11. Is the <hi>Religion</hi> of <hi>Oxford,</hi> yea, of the Rebels of <hi>Ireland,</hi> worſe then this? 12. What had we to do to undergo ſuch a War againſt the Malignants, if we were minded to <hi>tolerate</hi> all the <hi>Religions,</hi> we now fight againſt? yea, and many others ten times worſe? What were that, but to ſhew our ſelves more Malignants then they are? yea, to declare them juſt, and our ſelves, perfidious Rebels? Sure he, that would ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe ſuch a <hi>Toleration,</hi> muſt be out of his wits, worſe then a Papiſt, yea, then a Pagan. 13. Neither know we any ſuch <hi>Toleration,</hi> but amongſt the Turks, who yet <hi>tolerate</hi> no man to ſpeak againſt <hi>Mahumet.</hi> 14. And I muſt ſay, that it were better living amongſt the Turks, then amongſt ſuch Chriſtians; for the leſſe their light is, the more excuſeable are they; and the greater ours, the greater is our ſin, and the more inexcuſeable are we. 15. And if the <hi>Parliament</hi> ſhould follow your Counſell, good <hi>M. S.</hi> it ſhould be to be feared, they ſhould be ill obeyed, and that many good men would rather take the <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Cavaliers</hi> by the hand; and in caſe of neceſſity, <hi>tolerate</hi> them both, and let themſelves be plundered, then conſent to ſuch an abominable <hi>perjury;</hi> and I am aſſured, the one is much more tolerable, then the other is; and then what ſhould become of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and us all? 16. But tell me, I pray thee, <hi>M. S.</hi> Is it not a <hi>Maxime</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> laid down, as indubitable by thoſe, who have written in favour of theſe <hi>Defenſive Wars</hi> of both the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,</hi> That the <hi>King</hi> in Temporall and Civill Matters hath not an <hi>abſolute,</hi> but a <hi>limitted Power,</hi> and that becauſe, that <hi>Soveraign Power</hi> is originally in the People, but <hi>ſubjectivè,</hi> or <hi>quoad uſum, &amp; exercitium</hi> in the <hi>King.</hi> If that hold in the <hi>King,</hi> wherefore not alſo in the <hi>Parliament?</hi> But how much more in matters of <hi>Religion,</hi> that depend not either of <hi>King,</hi> or <hi>Parliament;</hi> but of <hi>Gods Will?</hi> All power here, is <hi>originally in Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>quoad exercitium Miniſteriale</hi> in his <hi>Officers,</hi> but from <hi>Chriſt.</hi> What Power hath either <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Parliament,</hi> to intrude and force upon the <hi>Kingdom</hi> new <hi>Religions,</hi> or a <hi>Toleration</hi> of all <hi>Sects?</hi> 17. The <hi>Parliament</hi> aſſumes no ſuch power to it ſelf; wherefore then will Independents be Suiters to them for any ſuch things, which they declare themſelves, they have not power to grant? Away with thee, <hi>M. S.</hi> and all thy Independent Sect, and all your unhappy Maximes of State, ſo pernitious to all States of the World.</p>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:124638:96"/>
               <p>After all this, this <hi>M. S.</hi> telleth us, that they will, with <hi>Iſaac,</hi> patiently ſuffer themſelves to be bound, and offered in Sacrifice, if need be.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> It is eaſie to offer your ſelves to be Sacrificed, when there is no Prieſt, and when no man offers you any violence, but onely prayes you to live amongſt us, as Brethren; and not to trouble the <hi>Church, State,</hi> or <hi>Kingdom:</hi> If you be minded to become ſuch a Free-will-offering, in good earneſt, ye would do well all of you in the firſt place, to quit the good fat Benefices ye have in the Church? But ſo long as ye keep them, we cannot beleeve, that ye ſpeak ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely: Alwayes, it is a pretty Compliment, and a <hi>painted Sacrifice,</hi> not with <hi>red,</hi> but <hi>in white and black.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to cloſe up his Reaſons, he concludes thus; <hi>Better a thouſand times is it, that ſuch diſtempers as theſe, though found in millions of men, ſhould ſuffer, were it never ſo deep,</hi> then <hi>that the leaſt Hair of the Head, of one of thoſe men, ſhould fall to the ground. i. e.</hi> Better that millions of us, who deſire the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of all Sects, ſhould ſuffer, then that any of them ſhould looſe but one, yea, the leaſt Hair of their Head.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. S.</hi> To this I can ſay nothing; But if we in your Opinion, be ſo <hi>diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered,</hi> for the <hi>deſire</hi> we have to ſee <hi>Sects ſuppreſſed,</hi> whereby God is offended, the Lord be judge betwixt us; <hi>How precious in your eyes, one little Hair of your Head is,</hi> which ye prefer before the ſufferings of ſo many millions, the Reader will do well to take it into his conſideration, and accordingly to judge of you; what a high rate you ſet by your ſelves; and what an undervalue ye put upon all the World beſides. I am aſſured, that <hi>ſervatâ proportione,</hi> one of your lives is better then the <hi>Kings,</hi> and all the <hi>Parliaments,</hi> put together; for there is none of them, but rather then that one man ſhould dye, they would part with the Hair, of their Heads, and Beards both.</p>

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>. S.</hi> in the ſecond Chapter of his Book, Section 28. hath ſome Arguments againſt the Power of the Civill Magiſtrate, to puniſh Idolaters, Heretiques, and Schiſmatiques, which ſeem alſo to make for a <hi>Toleration;</hi> for theſe two Queſtions have a great Affinity together: Wherefore I thought it fitteſt to put off my Anſwer unto them, to the laſt place.</p>
            <p>The firſt is; God hath anointed his Word, and the Miniſtery thereof, <hi>For the caſting down imaginations, and every high thing, that exalts it ſelf againſt the knowledge of God, and for the bringing into captivity, every high thought unto the Obedience of Chriſt,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.5. <hi>And he gave ſome to be Apoſtles,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11, 12. <hi>&amp;c. Ergo,</hi> The Civill Magiſtrate hath no power to puniſh Heretiques, Schiſmatiques, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but muſt <hi>tolerate</hi> them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A. S.</hi> 1. I deny the Conſequence; For the Miniſters of the Church are <hi>anointed</hi> to beat them down by Spirituall means, <hi>viz.</hi> The Word, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of alone thoſe Texts ſpeak: But the Civill Magiſtrate is <hi>anointed,</hi> or called to beat them down by other means, <hi>viz.</hi> by Civill Power, and Civill Laws, which he is bound to make thereabouts, and to ſee obſerved.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If this Argument hold, the Civill Magiſtrate cannot beat down, by his Civill Authority, Sins committed againſt the ſecond Table, as Adultery, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe, that the Miniſters of God, in the Church, beat them down <hi>ſpiritually</hi> by the Word. And this Text is, as well to be underſtood of Sins againſt the one, as the other Table.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Howſoever, the power of the Miniſtery, or <hi>Eccleſiaſticall Power</hi> be able and ſufficient to beat down all ſin <hi>ſpiritually,</hi> yet is it not ſufficient, or able to beat it down <hi>politically.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Neither ſay theſe Texts, that God hath <hi>anointed,</hi> or ordained the <hi>Word,</hi> and <hi>Miniſtery</hi> alone, and no other means, or Miniſters, as the Laws of the Kingdom and the Civill Magiſtrate, in a Politicall way, for ſuch an effect.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It is true, as <hi>M. S.</hi> ſayes, that God <hi>gave</hi> not <hi>ſome</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> to be
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:124638:97"/>
               <hi>Kings, Princes, Judges, and Juſtices of Peace, Purſevants, Jaylors,</hi> &amp;c. For Chriſt, and his Apoſtles erected not any Civill Government in the State, but ſuppoſed it already conſtituted in the <hi>Old Teſtament:</hi> And that the Civill Magiſtrate therein, was endowed with Civill Authority, to puniſh ſuch as trouble the Peace of the Church.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Howbeit, that in this Text, there is no mention made of the Civill Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates Power to puniſh ſuch perſons; yet is it declared in other Texts, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1. <hi>There is no power, but of God. Ergo,</hi> It is for God, ſince God is both the firſt <hi>Efficient,</hi> and the laſt, or <hi>ultimate</hi> Finall Cauſe of all things, if he be for God. <hi>Ergo,</hi> He is to revenge his Cauſe, ſince he is his Miniſter, <hi>Ver.</hi> 4. And when he maketh a Politicall Ordinance concerning Gods ſervice, <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever reſiſteth his power, reſiſts the Ordinance of God; and they that reſiſt, ſhall receive to themſelvet condemnation,</hi> both eternall and temporall, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 2. <hi>if thou do that which is evill, be afraid, for he beareth not the ſword in vain, for he is the Miniſter of God,</hi> as well in the State, as the Preacher in the Church, <hi>a revenger to execute wrath upon him, that doth evill:</hi> Here there is no diſtinction or reſtriction in the Law. <hi>Ergo,</hi> It is not for us, to diſtinguiſh, or reſtrain it: <hi>He is the Miniſter of God for good, Verſ.</hi> 4. <hi>Ergo,</hi> For this good, <hi>viz.</hi> to have a care of <hi>Religion,</hi> and to puniſh ſuch, as trouble it by their Schiſms, and Hereſies.</p>
            <p>And therefore, 6. I deny the Conſequence; For <hi>Poſito uno Medio, non ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantur reliqua;</hi> It followeth not, That if God ſerve himſelf of ſome means in the Church: <hi>Ergo,</hi> He ſerveth himſelf, of any other means, <hi>viz.</hi> of Civill Authority about the Church, and out of the Church: That were, as if I ſhould ſay; The <hi>internall Cauſes,</hi> as <hi>Materia &amp; Forma,</hi> are neceſſary to the Generation of a man; <hi>Ergo,</hi> The <hi>Externall,</hi> as the <hi>Efficient</hi> and <hi>Finall, viz.</hi> God and man are not neceſſary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>M. S.</hi> 2. The Miniſters of the Church muſt perform their Office with meekneſſe, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.24. <hi>Ergo,</hi> They muſt not threaten men with delivering them over to the Civill Magiſtrate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A. S.</hi> I anſwer to the Antecedent; They muſt perform their duty, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with meekneſſe; but alſo with ſeverity, when neceſſity requireth it, as we ſee in Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> 2. The Text, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.24. ſpeaketh onely of <hi>meekneſſe</hi> in teaching; <hi>In meekneſſe</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>inſtructing thoſe that oppoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, if peradventure God will give them repentance.</hi> 3. It onely ſaith, that they muſt uſe <hi>meekneſſe,</hi> when men are docilo; when there is any hope of Repentance; and not with pertinacious Heretiques, and Schiſmatiques, of whom we cannot expect Repentance. 4. I deny the Conſequence; When the Miniſters of the Church threaten them, to deliver them over unto the Civill Magiſtrate, they may do that alſo with <hi>meekneſſe:</hi> Neither is ſuch a proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contrary to <hi>meekneſſe;</hi> for the <hi>meekeſt</hi> man of the World may accuſe his Party before the Civill Magiſtrate; and yet not be thought inhumane, or
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:124638:97"/>cruell. 5. Thus, All being beaten down, all that he builds upon this ruinous Foundation, muſt needs fall to ground.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>M. S.</hi> his third Reaſon: That which is a ſpeciall gift of God, and whereof no man is capable, by his own induſtry, the want of it (being in it ſelf a judgement of God, and withall, no wayes prejudiciall, or hurtfull unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) ſhould not expoſe him to further puniſhment and miſery: But <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to the acknowledgement of the Truth,</hi> is a ſpeciall gift of God, and the want thereof, a judgement of God; <hi>&amp;c. Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A. S.</hi> 1. I deny the firſt Propoſition; For if he be bound to have it, and had the faculty, and ſufficient means to have had it, and to keep it after that he had it, or might have it; and if by his own fault he want it, he cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe himſelf neither from the Obligation to have, nor from the Puniſhment due to him for the want of it, as our Divines teach againſt the Arminians.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I deny the Aſſumption; for it is prejudiciall to others, by the ill example he gives, and by the malice proceeding from thence, that induces others to the ſame ſin, to falſe Doctrines, Schiſms, and Hereſies.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This Argument proveth not <hi>M. S.</hi> his <hi>Theſis, viz.</hi> That the Civill Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate ſhould not puniſh Heretiques and Schiſmatiques, or that they ſhould be <hi>tolerated</hi> in the State.</p>
            <p>And therefore, 4. we may grant him all the Argument. Neither doth the Civill Magiſtrate puniſh any man for want of Repentance, or for his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, which are in the minde and will, and conſequently unknown to him; but for the pertinacious Externall Profeſſion of them; in ſo far forth, as they trouble the peace of the Church, and the State. Neither refuſeth he to <hi>tolerate</hi> ignorance, or want of repentance; yea, if there be nothing worſe in them, both the Civill Magiſtrate, and the Miniſters of Chriſt, muſt pitty them, and travell for their inſtruction and amendment. This is far from proving either a <hi>Toleration</hi> of the Publike Exerciſe of Hereticall Doctrines, or of Schiſms, or that the Civill Magiſtrate hath not power to puniſh them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>M. S.</hi> his fourth Reaſon being put in Form, will be thus; That which maketh men worſe, and Hypocrites, to profeſſe outwardly, what they beleeve not in their Conſciences, is not lawfull: But Externall Compulſion of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, Schiſmaticks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in matters of Religion, made by the Civill Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, is ſuch: <hi>Ergo,</hi> It is unlawfull, and conſequently not to be <hi>tolerated.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A. S.</hi> I anſwer to the firſt Propoſition; If it make men worſe <hi>per Accidens,</hi> not of it ſelf, but in vertue of ſome Accident, annexed to the perſon, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh worſe; it is falſe: If it do it <hi>per ſe,</hi> by its <hi>own vertue, and efficacy;</hi> it is true: But then the Aſſumption is falſe; for the Civill Magiſtrate, in puniſhing Hereticks and Schiſmaticks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> maketh them not worſe <hi>per ſe;</hi> for neither is it <hi>finis Operantis,</hi> or <hi>Operationis;</hi> ſince neither he intends to make them worſe, but better; nor tends his Operation; <hi>i. e.</hi> his Iudgement and Command to make them at all ill, much leſſe to make them worſe; ſince the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:124638:98"/>effect of it <hi>per ſe</hi> is onely to impriſon their bodies, to fine them, or, if they merit it, to exile them, or take their lives; which produceth no morall ill, but a great good, <hi>viz.</hi> a hinderance of them to vent abroad their Hereſies and Schiſms. So it maketh them not Hypocrites <hi>per ſe;</hi> but onely they <hi>per ſe</hi> make themſelves Hypocrites: They are bound to ſuffer themſelves to be taught the Truth, ſo to beleeve it, and ſo they ſhall not be Hypocrites.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>M. S.</hi> replieth, That he ſtands already engaged in a greater band hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, <hi>viz.</hi> His peace with God, and the ſafety of his Soul, then ſuffering tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally from the Civill Power.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A. S.</hi> Your erroneous Conſcience can breed no true, and reall Obligation, or Engagement againſt God: 1. For you are bound, and obliged to God to caſt away your Ignorance, and ill Conſcience: 2. What if your Erroneous Conſcience dictate you, that you muſt kill the King, as that of <hi>Ravalliack</hi> did to him in <hi>France,</hi> to kill <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth; and that of the Jeſuites and Prieſts in <hi>England</hi> did them, to blow up the Parliament, and many Papiſts of their own Religion; Muſt you I pray, obey the dictate of ſuch a Conſcience? 3. Away with ſuch wicked Conſciences; and <hi>to the Law, and Prophets,</hi> if you be a Proteſtant. 4. Either that <hi>band</hi> is laid upon you by God, or the Devill: But it cannot be laid upon you by God; for he cannot lay a <hi>band</hi> upon you, to ſerve the Devill, or to deſpight himſelf, for ſo he ſhould be the Author of ſin; nor by the Devill; for then the <hi>band</hi> laid upon you to ſerve him, ſhould be greater then that, which God hath laid upon you in his Word, to ſerve him.</p>
            <p>It may be ſaid, That ſo long as my Erroneous Conſcience laſteth, I muſt obey it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A. S.</hi> I anſwer, you muſt obey it, as he, who is captive under ſin, muſt obey ſin, being a ſlave unto ſin, that hath voluntarily rendered him ſuch; but he unjuſtly rendered himſelf a ſlave to ſin, and unjuſtly, in vertue thereof, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth a ſinner, and obeyeth it.</p>
            <p>Some will Anſwer, 7. That <hi>Conſcientia erronea ligat, ſed non obligat,</hi> an erroneous Conſcience bindes a man ſo up, that it hindereth him to do the good, but it obliges him not to do the ill, that it dictateth.</p>
            <p>Neither is this the Queſtion, Whether an Heretick is bound to beleeve what the Magiſtrate willeth him to beleeve; But whether he ſhould have power to erect Churches againſt the Orthodox Religion, as the Independents would; And whether, or no, the Civill Magiſtrate can hinder him by his Civill Power, from ſo doing. Now the Argument proveth not the Negative part; neither doth the Civill Magiſtrate compell private men to <hi>beleeve,</hi> but <hi>not</hi> to <hi>trouble</hi> the <hi>peace</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> in ſetting up of others without his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>M. S.</hi> his fifth Reaſon; If the Civill Magiſtrate hath an actuall Coercive power to ſuppreſſe Schiſms and Hereſies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe he is truely a Chriſtian;
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:124638:98"/>then Chriſtianity changeth the propertie, and tenour of his Magiſtracy, and that for the worſe; for in vertue thereof he acquireth a power to cruſh his Subjects for the exerciſe of their Conſcience, yea, to perſecute the Saints, which he had not before; If ſo, Chriſtians have little reaſon to pray for his Converſion: But the Conſequent is falſe. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>A. S.</hi> 1. I deny the Conſequence of the Propoſition; for both the Chriſtian and Unchriſtian Magiſtrate have the actuall Coercive power, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, they have not both actually the act of that Power; for both the one, and the other, hath that Morall power <hi>in actu ſignato,</hi> or the Remote power; but the Chriſtian Magiſtrate onely hath it <hi>in actu exercito, i. e.</hi> The immediate Authority to exerciſe it, becauſe he hath, or ſhould have, or is ſuppoſed morally to have all things requiſite to the exerciſe thereof: So is it not in a Pagan; for he hath not the knowledge of the Goſpel, whereby he ſhould exerciſe it, nor the will to exerciſe it juſtly, which is preſuppoſed to it: ſo he hath, as it were, <hi>poteſtatem, ſed caret uſu poteſtatis,</hi> as a Childe, that hath a reaſonable Soul, and all the reaſonable Faculties, that a man hath, but he hath not the uſe of Reaſon, or of thoſe reaſonable Faculties; he hath <hi>facultatem, quaſi ligatam,</hi> as he, who cannot ſee for a tye that he hath in his eye. 2. I deny that Chriſtianity changeth his power to worſe; for it is not, as you ſay, to cruſh good, but to mend and reform ignorant, and ill men, and to chaſtiſe them, <hi>Nulla enim potentia ad malum,</hi> the Apoſtle telleth you, that he is the <hi>Miniſter of God to thee for good, Rom.</hi> 3.4. <hi>Rulers are not a terrour to good works. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the Power? Do that which is good, Verſ.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>M. S.</hi> his ſixth Argument. That power is very dangerous to a Magiſtrate to own, in the exerciſe whereof, he may very eaſily run an hazard (at leaſt) <hi>in fighting againſt God,</hi> or in <hi>plucking up</hi> that, which God hath <hi>planted,</hi> or in pulling down that, which God hath <hi>built.</hi> But ſuch is that power of ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Schiſms, Hereſies, <hi>&amp;c. Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Aſſumption, he proveth it, becauſe the Opinions that he ſees by other mens eyes to be ſchiſmaticall, may be the wayes of God. 1. Becauſe the judgements of theſe men are not Apoſtolicall. 2. Frequent experience ſhews, that a Minor part, yea, an inconſiderable number of godly Perſons in a Church, may have the minde of God in ſome particularities, before the Major part have it. 3. It ſeldom, or never falleth out, that any truth, which hath for a long time been under Hatches, and unknown to the generality of Miniſters in a Church, hath been at the firſt, and on the ſudden revealed, either to the Generality, or to the Major part of them. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A. S.</hi> I anſwer, 1. to the firſt; It is no more dangerous, then the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy it ſelf: ſo as if it be dangerous to own the Magiſtracy; ſo is it likewiſe to own that part of it, whereby, in vertue of his Civill Power, he ruleth the Church civilly; and ſo all the Argument may be granted; and the greater that
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:124638:99"/>the danger is to own it, the greater a great deal ſhould his circumſpection be. 2. If this Argument hold, it will conclude no leſſe againſt the Civill, and Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall Government of the Old Teſtament, and that of the Civill Magiſtrate of <hi>New England</hi> alſo. 3. I may deny the Major; for if he accept of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy, it is a far greater danger not to accept this part of the charge; for there is a neceſſity laid upon him in vertue of the Magiſtracy, to accept it, as the principall part thereof. 4. The greater that the danger and difficulty be, ſo much the greater is the vertue in exerciſing of it, and the greater will the retribution be for it. 5. It is not very dangerous to own the <hi>charge,</hi> but not to <hi>exerciſe</hi> it <hi>faithfully.</hi> 6. To the Aſſumption I Anſwer, That it is but one of <hi>M. S.</hi> his <hi>may be's, quod nihil ponit in re;</hi> The Confirmations of it alſo contain but <hi>may be's.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their <hi>judgements</hi> I grant you, are not <hi>Apoſtolicall:</hi> 1. But no more are the <hi>judgements</hi> of your <hi>particular Congregations.</hi> 2. Or thoſe of the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament,</hi> or of any mortall men, at leaſt ordinarily, and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they are lawfull. 3. Neither is it needfull, that they be infallible, but without fault onely.</p>
            <p>To the ſecond proof. 1. It is but a <hi>may be,</hi> which yet <hi>may not be.</hi> 2. And it is extraordinary. 3. And howbeit it were ſo ordinarily, yet followeth it not, that your Independents are ſuch. 4. If it were ſo, Gods truth Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily ſhould not prevail. 5. All Schiſmaticks and Hereticks, who are few in number, may ſay as much; So Miſtreſſe <hi>Hutchinſon</hi> in <hi>New England,</hi> Ile warrant you, ſaid no leſſe.</p>
            <p>To the third. 1. I deny, that the truth, whereof we diſpute, hath been <hi>under the Hatches,</hi> as ye pretend. 2. All Hereticks and Schiſmaticks ſay the ſame. 3. And in all theſe his Reaſons, he argueth evermore <hi>a facto ad jus,</hi> from the Fact to the Law; and from that which is, to that which ſhould be; and from that which may be, to that which is. The Authority of <hi>Gamaliel, Act.</hi> 4. is but of a prophane Politician, who would rule the Church and Religion, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Politicall Ends.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>M. S.</hi> 7. Reaſon. That Power, which was never attributed to the Civill Magiſtrate, by any Chriſtians, but onely by thoſe that had very good aſſurance, that it ſhould be uſed for them, appertaineth not to him by divine right. But that Coercive Power in matters of <hi>Religion,</hi> for the ſuppreſſing of Errours, Schiſms, Hereſies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was never attributed to the Civill Magiſtrate, by any Chriſtian, but onely by thoſe, that had very good aſſurance, that it ſhould be uſed for them. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A. S.</hi> I anſwer; That if the word <hi>Power</hi> in the Major, and Minor be taken for an <hi>Eccleſiaſticall Power,</hi> which is <hi>intrinſecall</hi> to the Church, I grant you all the Argument; neither concludes it any thing againſt us: But if it be taken for a <hi>Politicall Power,</hi> that is <hi>extrinſecall</hi> to the Church, whereby he puniſhes Hereticks and Schiſmaticks, by Civill puniſhments, the Minor is falſe, as I have already ſhewed by my Arguments; And what he ſaith of my
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:124638:99"/>tenderneſſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it is but Language inſtead of Reaſons. 2. If the <hi>Extrinſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call power</hi> be taken for a <hi>remote power,</hi> or <hi>in actu ſignato,</hi> the <hi>Minor</hi> is falſe; neither proveth he it; but we have proved the contrary; for both Pagans, and Chriſtians have it: If it be taken for a <hi>neerer Immediate power,</hi> or <hi>in actu exercito,</hi> the <hi>Minor</hi> is true of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nchriſtian,</hi> but falſe of the <hi>Chriſtian Magiſtrate,</hi> as I have told you again, and again, and proved it. 3. But is not this <hi>Power</hi> granted to the <hi>Civill Magiſtrate,</hi> by the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of <hi>New England?</hi> 4. And was it not granted him in the <hi>Old Teſtament?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>M. S.</hi> 8. Argument. The exerciſe of a <hi>Coactive power</hi> of the <hi>Civill Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,</hi> againſt Hereticks, Schiſmaticks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in matters of Religion, tends directly to prevent, hinder, or ſuppreſſe, the growth of the Knowledge of God, and Jeſus Chriſt, in the Church, and State, and the Reformation of Doctrine, and Diſcipline. <hi>Ergo,</hi> It is not of Divine Inſtitution.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A. S.</hi> I anſwer, 1. I deny the Antecedent, or I diſtinguiſh it; if it do all that <hi>per accidens,</hi> I deny the Conſequence; if <hi>per ſe,</hi> the Antecedent is falſe.</p>
            <p>But <hi>M. S.</hi> proveth his Aſſumption in ſubſtance thus: When the Civill Magiſtrate holds any thing in Religion, it is a great temptation, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement upon the Subject, to ſearch out the Truth in Scripture; for if he finde it, againſt the Tenets of the Civill Magiſtrate, one of two things muſt follow. Either out of fear of puniſhment, he withholdeth the truth in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe; and ſo hath God and his own Conſcience, for his Enemy; or elſe he profeſſeth it; and ſo hath his bones broken for it: So theſe two dangers may tempt him not to read the Scripture.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A. S.</hi> 1. This proveth not that thing which is denyed. 2. I deny that the power of the Civill Magiſtrate, ſince it is onely to good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. can <hi>per ſe</hi> cauſe any ſuch Temptation. 3. Howbeit, a man diſcover any Truth in Scripture againſt the Tenets of the Chriſtian Magiſtrate, that he needs to fear any ſuch thing; for the true Chriſtian Magiſtrate will not be ſo barbarous againſt the Truth, howbeit he think it to be an errour; for he may be curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to learn it; and if he that hath found it, be prudent and not turbulent, he needs not to ſuffer for it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>M. S.</hi> 9. Argument; The exerciſe of a Coactive power in matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which <hi>A. S.</hi> and many others, pin upon the Civill Magiſtrate, tends to the gratification of Satan, and of carnall and prophane men: <hi>Ergo,</hi> It is not of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A. S.</hi> I deny the Antecedent; for then it ſhould be a gratification of Satan, to puniſh Hereticks and Schiſmaticks; and ſo to deſtroy his Kingdom, which is mainly up held by them.</p>
            <p>But <hi>M. S.</hi> proveth it, 1. For many of thoſe, that are like to ſuffer by it, are men of good Conſcience, and truly fearing God, as the Apologiſts, and men of their Iudgement.</p>
            <pb n="188" facs="tcp:124638:100"/>
            <p>
               <hi>A. S.</hi> 1. We ſee no appearance, that thoſe your <hi>men of good conſcience</hi> are like to <hi>ſuffer,</hi> howſoever they have very highly offended againſt the <hi>Civill Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates Authority;</hi> and ſome of you, as one <hi>M. S.</hi> in the firſt Edition of his Book, writes, that the name of <hi>Steuart</hi> hath been <hi>funeſt</hi> to <hi>England,</hi> in King <hi>James,</hi> and King <hi>Charls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. If they <hi>ſuffer,</hi> Ile warrant you it will never be for their good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but for ſome worſe thing.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>M. S.</hi> for fear that we ſhould deny them to be <hi>men</hi> of <hi>good Conſcience,</hi> proveth it by two Reaſons.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Becauſe <hi>A. S.</hi> confeſſed it: But this hath been ſundry times anſwered.</item>
               <item>2. Becauſe it is not ordinary, that men of <hi>looſe,</hi> or <hi>no Conſcience,</hi> ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to <hi>ſwim againſt the ſtreams</hi> of <hi>greatneſſe</hi> or <hi>pluralitie</hi> in matters of Religion.</item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <hi>A. S.</hi> But the Devill hath his own Martyrs, as God hath his: And one <hi>Vaninus,</hi> an Atheiſt in <hi>France,</hi> choſe rather to die, then to renounce his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm; and ſo was drowned for his thus <hi>ſwiming againſt the ſtreams of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and plurality.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>M. S.</hi> proveth the ſecond part of the Aſſumption, <hi>viz.</hi> That ſuch a Civill Power in the Civill Magiſtrate, about matters of Religion, is a gratification of ignorant and carnall men; becauſe they deſire alwayes, Sects, and Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions in Religion to be ſuppreſſed, ſave onely that, which ſhall be authorized and practiſed in the State; for ſo they ſhall not be much troubled to ſeek it, they know not where, or amongſt whom.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A. S.</hi> 1. And if the <hi>true Religion</hi> be to be <hi>eſtabliſhed</hi> in the <hi>State,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are they not to be gratified therein? What greater crime is it in them, then in good men, to deſire the <hi>true Religion</hi> to be <hi>eſtabliſhed</hi> in the <hi>State;</hi> and all <hi>Sects</hi> and <hi>Hereſies</hi> to be <hi>ſuppreſſed?</hi> 2. Are they <hi>ignorant</hi> and <hi>carnall,</hi> who deſire <hi>one onely,</hi> and that the <hi>true Religion</hi> to be <hi>eſtabliſhed;</hi> and <hi>they onely learned,</hi> and <hi>ſpirituall,</hi> that deſire <hi>many Sects,</hi> and <hi>Hereſies,</hi> whereby the good Name of God is blaſphemed, to ſubſiſt? 3. If that be ill; I am affraid the next word will be, that you will ſay, God did not well in <hi>eſtabliſhing</hi> the <hi>true Religion</hi> amongſt his people, and in <hi>ſuppreſſing</hi> of <hi>Sects.</hi> 4. And no better do your <hi>Independents</hi> in <hi>New England,</hi> in <hi>ſuppreſſing</hi> of all <hi>Sects,</hi> ſave their own. If this be a crime, I pray God we be all criminall, and that God have no greater crime to charge us with. 5. But deſire you, <hi>M. S.</hi> to have many <hi>Sects</hi> and <hi>Hereſies</hi> in the Kingdom, to ſhew your great Learning in refuting of them, as the Souldiers would have the War to continue, to ſhew their valour, and therein to finde their preferment? I pray you not to be offended with us, if we deſire to be <hi>gratified with the moſt ignorant,</hi> in <hi>ſuppreſſing</hi> them, and in <hi>eſtabliſhing</hi> the <hi>true Religion:</hi> So the <hi>Parliament</hi> and <hi>Synod</hi> are <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,</hi> for this is their deſire.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>M. S.</hi> 10. Argument. That power, which in the uſe of it, directly tends
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:124638:100"/>to defile the Conſcience of men is, a power from beneath, and not from above.</p>
            <p>But ſuch is the Coercive power in matters of Religion, wherewith <hi>A. S.</hi> would fain befriend himſelf with the Civill Magiſtrate. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Major, I grant it. The Aſſumption, if it have any ſenſe, is this in ſubſtance: When a man is deeply threatned, in caſe he ſhall not comply with the State, in their Religion, againſt his Conſcience, 1. Either God leaves ſuch a mans Conſcience to it ſelf, and it is hardned; 2. Or by reflecting upon what it hath done, it brings it ſelf into grievous Agonies, of which, it never recovers afterward.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A. S.</hi> This is a very ſtrange Caſe of Conſcience, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>M. S.</hi> his, and ſuch like Independent Conſciences, are ſo tender and delicate, that they are ſorely wounded, if they may not have a liberty to become Hereticall, and go to the Devill.</p>
            <p>But I anſwer, 1. The Aſſumption is falſe; for the <hi>Externall Coactive Power,</hi> that <hi>A. S.</hi> grants unto the Civill Magiſtrate, is onely to repreſſe Hereticks, and Schiſmaticks, after that they are ſufficiently convicted by the Church, in an ordinary way; or by others, in an extraordinary way, when the Church is negligent in her duty.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Neither doth <hi>M. S.</hi> his Confirmation, or Caſe of Conſcience conclude any thing againſt that, which <hi>A. S.</hi> ſayes: And as for his Suppoſition, either that Conſcience, whereof he ſpeaketh, is <hi>right,</hi> or <hi>erroneous:</hi> If it be <hi>right;</hi> the Civill Magiſtrate ſhould not preſſe it againſt its light; or if he happen to do ſo, it is not by Power, but by abuſe of Power; And in ſuch a caſe, he, who hath his Conſcience well informed, muſt reſolve himſelf to be quiet, in caſe the Civill Magiſtrate oblige him not to be Actor in any thing againſt it: But if ſuch a man, any other, or others with him, will riſe up within the Kingdom, or come from Forraign Countries, and urge their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion upon the State, and eſtabliſh it, without permiſſion of the Magiſtrate, or againſt his Laws, then their Conſciences cannot be <hi>right;</hi> for wherefore ſhould the King, Parliament, and State, be rather bound to admit ſuch mens Religion, without ſufficient conviction, then they to admit his Religion? And in ſuch a Caſe, the Civill Magiſtrate, ſo long as ſuch perſons as urge their Religion upon him, convict not ſufficiently his Conſcience, may with a good Conſcience puniſh them ſeverely, yea, with good Conſcience cut off their Heads. If ſuch a mans Conſcience be erroneous, the Civill Magiſtrate doth him no wrong to endeavour, that he, who hath it, be ſufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed; and, if after ſufficient conviction, he will not be quiet, (eſpecially, when he is not obliged to be Actor in any thing againſt his pretended Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience) but will ſtill trouble both Church, and State; wherefore, on Gods Name ſhould he not be puniſhed? 2. Is it not better, that ſuch a man ſhould periſh, then that he ſhould make thouſands to periſh? 3. <hi>Ravalliack</hi> in
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:124638:101"/>
               <hi>France,</hi> and the Monks, and Fryers, that kill Kings, pretend evermore Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, as the Independents do; and yet the Civill Magiſtrate puts them to death. 4. If any mans Conſcience, (which God forbid) ſhould dictate him to kill the King, and blow up the Parliament, ſhould ſuch a man be tolerated, under pretext of his tender Conſcience? 5. Is it not a ſin to have an erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Conſcience? And is not he, that hath it, bound to reform it, and to ſuffer for it, in caſe he reform it not, when he hath ſufficient means to do it? 6. But muſt every man, that doth ill, be preſently believed, when he ſaith, that he hath ſuch a Conſcience? 7. All this long Sermon of <hi>M. S.</hi> proveth not, that the Magiſtrate <hi>directly,</hi> and <hi>per ſe,</hi> but rather that the man himſelf hardeneth his own Conſcience; for there is no created Power, that <hi>directly, per ſe,</hi> and <hi>Phyſically,</hi> can work upon a mans Conſcience; it can onely move it <hi>morally,</hi> in propounding of Objects to it, or in Reaſoning; and yet every true <hi>Chriſtian</hi> hath a ſufficient power to reſiſt ſuch motions, which is ſufficient to make him in-excuſable. 8. Neither can his erroneous Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence excuſe him, unleſſe that its <hi>Errour</hi> be <hi>Invincible, Antecedent,</hi> and he no wayes the cauſe of it; but if it be <hi>Vincible, Concomitant,</hi> or <hi>Subſequent,</hi> and he himſelf the cauſe of it, then it excuſeth him not, but is a ſin, and aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates the ſin that proceedeth of it, at leaſt <hi>extenſivè,</hi> if not <hi>intenſivè;</hi> For in ſuch a caſe, it is not his erroneous Conſcience, that is the cauſe of the <hi>ſinfull action of his Will,</hi> but his <hi>ſinfull Will,</hi> that is the cauſe of his <hi>erroneous Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi> 9. The <hi>Civill Magiſtrates</hi> threatning, <hi>per ſe,</hi> and <hi>directly,</hi> maketh not his <hi>Conſcience erroneous,</hi> but found it ſuch. 10. Neither is it the cauſe, that he goes againſt it; For whether ye conſider the <hi>Civill Magiſtrates</hi> Intention, his Iudgement, or the Execution of it in ſuch a caſe, they cauſe no ill, but good; for his Intention is onely, that they be gained to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and that they ſeduce not others; His Iudgement condemneth onely their Opinion, and commands a puniſhment anſwerable to their Sin, whereby onely they are hindered to continue in their Hereſies, or Schiſms, or to ſeduce others: No more doth the Execution of his Iudgement. <hi>Ergo.</hi> 11. And I pray this new <hi>Caſuiſt</hi> to tell me, whether in ſome <hi>Caſes</hi> it were not a leſſer Sin, for a man to go againſt his <hi>erroneous Conſcience,</hi> then to follow its Dictates? Whether it were not better for him to ſit at home, againſt the Dictate of his <hi>Conſcience,</hi> then to go to a <hi>Pagan Church,</hi> and there to adore a <hi>Crocodile,</hi> or a <hi>Toad,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Dictates of it.</p>
            <p>So we ſee, how licentious and deteſtable this <hi>Conſcience</hi> is, that Independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents plead ſo much for, that thinketh, that it cannot ſufficiently enjoy its li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, unleſſe that all Schiſmaticks, Hereticks, Jews, Mahumetans, and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters, have a free liberty of their <hi>erroneous Conſciences,</hi> to adore a thouſand Gods, yea, a thouſand Devils, a <hi>Jupiter,</hi> a <hi>Bacchus,</hi> a <hi>Venus,</hi> a blinde <hi>Fortuna,</hi> and to Preach ſuch Abominations; and that the <hi>Civill Magiſtrates power</hi> be ever curtaled, or rather altogether taken away in matters in Religion.</p>
            <pb n="191" facs="tcp:124638:101"/>
            <p>I will not call this a madneſſe, but I am well aſſured, that many are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to the Churches Prayers, that are not half ſo ſick, either in Soul or Body, as theſe men are in their <hi>Conſciences;</hi> Wherefore all that I have more to ſay unto them, ſhall be onely this; <hi>The Lord have mercy upon them.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving been deſired by ſome Friends, to give a ſhort Diſcourſe of the <hi>Independent Government,</hi> I am reſolved to preſent thee with this following <hi>Epitome;</hi> which ſundry have often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times required of me.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Independent Church</hi> is ſo called, becauſe that no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Congregation amongſt them, how ſmall, how Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, and vicious ſoever it be, will depend upon, or ſubmit to the Judgement of any other Church, yea, not to that of all the Churches of the World, how Orthodox, and holy, and how true and juſt ſoever their Judgement be.</p>
            <p>They define it, <hi>Coetus Fidelium,</hi> a Company of Beleevers, meeting in one place, every Lords Day, for the Adminiſtration of the Holy Ordinances of God, to publike Edification.</p>
            <p>So according to this Definition, neither the <hi>Catholike Church,</hi> which we beleeve in the <hi>Creed,</hi> nor any <hi>Nationall Church</hi> can be a <hi>true Church,</hi> ſince they cannot meet together, every Lords Day in one place.</p>
            <p>In the Efficient Cauſe of the Church, I ſee no great Difference betwixt us, and them, ſave onely this, That they hold it neceſſary to the Conſtitution of a Church, and of every Member thereof, that they all joyn in a particular <hi>Church-Covenant</hi> (as they call it) different from that of <hi>Grace,</hi> revealed in Scripture, wherein they all ſwear to live in the <hi>Faith,</hi> and in ſubjection to all the Ordinances of God, cleaving one to another, as Members of one Body, and not to depart from the ſaid particular Church, whereof they become Members, without the conſent thereof.</p>
            <p>The Antecedents of this <hi>Covenant</hi> are: 1. Sundry Meetings together of ſuch, as are to joyn in it, till ſuch time, as they may all have a ſufficient proof, and tryall of the <hi>ſpirituall eſtate,</hi> one of another. 2. The <hi>Civill Magiſtrates
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:124638:102"/>Conſent,</hi> to ſet up their Church. 3. The <hi>Conſent</hi> of <hi>Neighbour Churches.</hi> 4. They ordain a <hi>ſolemn Faſt;</hi> and after <hi>Prayers,</hi> and <hi>Sermons,</hi> one in the name of all the reſt propounds the <hi>Covenant.</hi> 5. And they all take it.</p>
            <p>The Conſequents of it are, 1. The Right hand of Fellowſhip, which is given them by the <hi>Neighbour Churches.</hi> 2. Thoſe, who joyn in <hi>Covenant,</hi> are exhorted to ſtand faſt in the Lord. 3. Followeth a <hi>Prayer</hi> made to God for pardon of their Sins, and acceptance of the People.</p>
            <p>We condemn not all <hi>Church-Covenants;</hi> but we cannot approve this of the <hi>Independents,</hi> 1. Becauſe it is not commanded in Scripture. 2. We finde no example of it in Scripture. 3. And therefore it is nothing elſe, but an humane Tradition. 4. Becauſe all, or almoſt all the <hi>Covenants</hi> concerning <hi>Religion,</hi> that we read of in Scripture, are of thoſe, that <hi>are already,</hi> and not of thoſe, that are <hi>to be</hi> Members of the Church. 5. Becauſe we are in <hi>Covenant</hi> with God before ever we come to be of Age; <hi>I ſhall be thy God, and of thy Seed, Gen.</hi> 17.7. Item, <hi>Be baptized; for to you and your Children the Promiſe is made, Acts</hi> 2.38. And from hence all Proteſtants prove the Baptiſm of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants againſt Anabaptiſts. 6. Becauſe, thoſe that were Circumciſed in the <hi>Old,</hi> and that are Baptized in the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> are Members of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall Church,</hi> without any vocall <hi>Covenant,</hi> as double <hi>C,</hi> who is one of theſe <hi>M. S. ſes,</hi> as I hear, confeſſeth freely: <hi>Ergo,</hi> They muſt be Members of ſome <hi>Particular Church;</hi> for how can they be in the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſall Church,</hi> and out of all <hi>Particular Churches?</hi> So a man might be in the World, and in no part of it, or out of all the parts of it. 7. Becauſe if Children Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed or Baptized were not in the Church, their condition ſhould be no better, then that of Jews and Pagans, which can be no great Conſolation to any Chriſtian Parents. 8. If a man of one Church ſhould take to Wife one of another, a hundred miles diſtant from him, ſhe muſt adhere to her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, live with him, and ſo quit her own Church, and be out of all Churches, like a Pagan; for ſhe cannot be admitted to the Church, whereunto ſhe goeth, but after a long tryall: So to be married, ſhe becometh as a Pagan. 9. Such an Oath or Promiſe is not lawfull; for a man may have juſt Cauſes, which are not evermore to be declared to a whole Church, that may oblige him to go, and live elſewhere in an other Church. 10. Becauſe the Apoſtles, Evangeliſts, and their Followers, could not lawfully enter into any ſuch <hi>Covenant,</hi> ſince they were <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſall Miniſters,</hi> &amp; conſequently <hi>Members</hi> of all the <hi>Churches</hi> of the World: 11. Neither could they make ſuch a tryall of three thouſand perſons, that in ſeven or eight houres time were added unto the Church, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.12. Such a <hi>Covenant</hi> includeth a tacite Schiſm, and Separation from all the Churches of the World. 13. Neither did the Apoſtles, and other Miniſters of the Church, for the firſt three hundred yeers, require the <hi>Civill Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates</hi> Conſent, to ſet up their Churches: 14. Neither is it neceſſary to the Internall Conſtitution, or Conſervation of it, ſince it is Extrinſecall to the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:124638:102"/>Church. 15. And ſome times it is impoſſible to be had, as when he is a Pagan, or an Antichriſtian Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>The Finall Cauſe of their Church, they pretend to be, 1. Gods glory. 2. The Salvation of the Church, and every Member thereof. 3. The Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and Externall Acts of mutuall Communion in Faith and Charity.</p>
            <p>The Matter of their Church, they hold to be ſuch Perſons, as can give ſome particular Evidences of ſaving Grace, and of their Election, and who enter into Church-Covenant together; ſuch as may be Arminians, as Maſter <hi>Goodwin, alias M. S.</hi> And as for the Members of other Churches, whether they be Dependents, or Independents, they will not admit them to the Lords Table, nor Baptize their Children, upon any Letters of Recommendation, that they can bring from other Churches; yea, howbeit they give a ſufficient account of their Faith, and live without giving any offence at all to any man; and ſo they hold them little better then Pagans.</p>
            <p>The Integrant p rts of this Church, are the Flock or People, and the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, <hi>viz.</hi> Preachers, Teachers, Ruling Elders, and Deacons.</p>
            <p>They admit none to be Ruling Elders, but ſuch as Preach; yea, to the People, they give liberty to Preach alſo; and ſo quite confound the Offices of Preachers, and Ruling Elders, which the Apoſtle diſtinguiſhes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. So they confound the charge of the Paſtor, with the duty of the Sheep, and a Ruler with him that is ruled.</p>
            <p>The Form of their Church ſeemeth to conſiſt in their Church-Covenant.</p>
            <p>The Accidents of it, are, 1. The number, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſmalleſt, ſeven Perſons; and the greateſt, as many, as can conveniently meet in one place, for the Adminiſtration of the Holy Ordinances of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Their Doctrine, which may be Arminian, as appeareth by <hi>M. S. alias</hi> Maſter <hi>Goodwin,</hi> who holds very many Arminian Tenets, as Juſtification by Faith, <hi>as it is an Act, or Quality, &amp;c. Item,</hi> As ſome teſtifie of him; A ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Soul.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They have no common Confeſſion of Faith, or Platform of Diſcipline in their <hi>Churches;</hi> neither will they have any; yea, they will not have any conſtant Confeſſion of Faith, or Platform of Diſcipline in any Particular; ſuch is the Liberty, or rather the Licenciouſneſſe of their Faith, and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The power to Teach, which they gram, as I have already ſaid, not onely to Preachers, but alſo to Ruling Elders, and ſome of the People.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The power of the Keyes, which they put in the hands of the People; yea, of the moſt ignorant, impertinent, and inſufficient of them, who have power to create their own Miniſters, to examine their Doctrine, and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, and afterward to admit them to the Charge.</p>
            <p>But whether they have, 1. Abilities. 2. And prudence enough to do it. 3. Whether Chriſt have committed the Keyes unto them. 4. Whether they
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:124638:103" rendition="simple:additions"/>can do it without confuſion. 5. Whether they had it in the <hi>Old Teſtament;</hi> I leave it to any judicious Readers conſideration.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Yea, ſome of them in the Synod, grant unto Women, ſome <hi>ſprinkling;</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, as ſome corrected them there, they would have ſaid, <hi>the gingling of the Keyes;</hi> but of this <hi>ſpinking, ſprinkling, or gingling of the Keyes,</hi> we read no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the Word of God.</p>
            <p n="7">7. They hold the Object of Excommunication onely to be errours of the Minde, againſt the common, and uncontroverted Principles; and of the Will, againſt the common, and univerſall practiſes of Chriſtianity; and both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Parties known light. So hardly can any man be Excommunicated. 1. For we cannot well know, when a man goeth againſt the common Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Chriſtianity, ſince no man can well define them. 2. Muchleſſe, when he goeth againſt the light of his Conſcience; or 3. againſt the common practiſes of Chriſtianity, which are not well known. 4. According to this Tenet, we cannot Excommunicate Socinians, Arminians, and other Hereticks; and therefore <hi>M. S.</hi> is admitted to be a Miniſter in one of their Churches. 5. Howbeit, they acknowledge no man in their Pariſh to be a Member of their Church, yet can they very well, and in good Conſcience, take a Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, were it never ſo great, yea, of 300, 400, or 500 l. a yeer. 6. They beleeve, that the <hi>Civill Magiſtrate</hi> ſhould not, and conſequently hath no power to puniſh Idolaters, or Hereticks, were their Hereſie never ſo great: And firſt, ſo (be it ſaid without Blaſphemy) God ſhould have been in the wrong, in commanding it in the <hi>Old Teſtament.</hi> Secondly, And it were very ſtrange, that a man ſhould be puniſhed for offending a man, and not for blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming the good Name of God. Thirdly, So he ſhould be puniſhed, for calling ſome Independents Knaves, but not for calling <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> the Sun of God, and the Redeemer of our Souls a Knave.</p>
